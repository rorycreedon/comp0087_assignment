[1]
Beaudry, J.
: This is an application for judicial review pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the Act), of a decision of a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment Officer (the Officer) dated January 21, 2009, where the Officer refused the Applicant's application for permanent residence based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds.
Factual Background
[2]
The Applicant, Fariba Masoumi Bavili, was born in Iran in 1960. The Applicant and her family were active members of the Baha'i faith. When the Applicant was 19 years old, she married Abbas Najafi, a Muslim man. Shortly after she was married, the Ayatollah came into power in Iran and it was no longer safe for those practicing the Baha'i faith to remain in Iran. The Applicant's parents and three siblings fled to Canada, where her parents and two siblings became permanent residents. The Applicant remained behind in Iran with her husband.
[3]
Shortly after her family left, the Applicant stated that her husband showed a more "fundamentalist" attitude toward her. He became very controlling and did not allow her to practice her faith. He also made many efforts to force her to renounce her faith and convert to Islam.
[4]
In 1984, the Applicant and her husband immigrated to Sweden and became permanent residents. She stated that she worked for many years and learned Swedish while her husband did not work and developed gambling and drug additions. The Applicant also stated that her husband became more abusive and she divorced him in 2001. While in Sweden, she gave birth to two children who are also applicants in this case: Sormeh Sally Najafi, born January 5, 2000, and Raha Richard Najafi born November 3, 2002.
[5]
The Applicant and her children entered Canada on May 10, 2004, after obtaining Temporary Resident visitor visas. These visas were extended twice. The Applicant then applied for refugee status for herself and her children on September 21, 2005. On September 28, 2005, the Applicant was determined to be ineligible to make a refugee claim under paragraph 101(1)(
d
) of the Act because she was recognized as a Convention refugee in Sweden. The children's refugee claims were heard on December 21, 2006 and the RPD determined on February 21, 2007, that the children were not Convention refugees.
[6]
The Applicant and her children applied for a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment. On July 14, 2008, the PRRA Officer determined that the children were not persons in need of protection or at risk of persecution, torture, risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. On July 15, 2008, the PRRA Officer also refused the Applicant's application. All three applications were refused because Sweden could provide state protection and the Applicants had not shown that it was not possible to avail themselves of such protection.
[7]
On January 9, 2009, the Applicant submitted a humanitarian and compassionate application for herself and her children. The Officer determined on January 21, 2009, that requiring the Applicants to apply for permanent residence from Sweden did not constitute unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship and the application was refused. The Applicants now seek judicial review of this decision.
Impugned Decision
[8]
The Officer first reviewed the establishment of the Applicant in Canada. He noted many facts about the Applicant's work history in Sweden, and that the Applicant had not worked since arriving in Canada and has received social assistance since 2006. He acknowledged that the Applicant had stated that she found it difficult to search for work while raising her children. However, he also noted that none of the Applicant's family in Canada had sponsored her or her children. Also, although the Applicant's family had stated that they would provide the Applicant with financial assistance, the Officer found that the Applicant's family was either unwilling or unable to do so considering the Applicant has been on social assistance since 2006. For these reasons, the Officer found that the Applicant's establishment in Canada was minimal.
[9]
The Officer then considered the best interests of the children. The Officer indicated that he was aware that the Applicant's children were in grade 1 and 3, but he found that the school system in Sweden was not significantly different from that in Canada and that it was not unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship for them to switch schools. The Officer also considered the family ties to Canada, including the Applicant's parents and two sisters, one of which has been diagnosed with cancer. The Officer found that there was insufficient evidence to establish that the Applicant's removal from Canada would seriously impact the level of care that the Applicant's sister was receiving and would not constitute hardship. The Officer also found that while separating from close family may be difficult, it is not an uncommon occurrence that warrants granting the Applicant an exemption on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. The Officer found that his decision was supported by the fact that the Applicant had visited her family three times previously and would be able to do so again after the one-year waiting period resulting from her removal order.
[10]
The Officer then went on to consider the allegation of risk and the psychological reports provided by the Applicant. He reviewed the Applicant's prior attempts to seek protection in Canada and the reasons for the refusals to grant refugee status or a positive PRRA. He then went on to review the psychological report of the Applicant and her daughter, both indicating the trauma resulting from the abuse of the Applicant's ex-husband. The Officer stated that he gave some weight to these reports in determining the effect that removal will have on the Applicant and her children, although he found that the conclusions regarding the suffering they would endure upon being returned to Sweden was speculative. The Officer also noted that did not give them much weight as evidence of the risk faced by the Applicant because these elements of the Applicant's case were found elsewhere.
[11]
The Officer then considered the risk presented by the Applicant's ex-husband. He stated that he had difficulty determining the facts, as a variety of statements and reports differed with regard to the current and future risk to the Applicant. He reviewed the submissions made by the Applicant regarding her ex-husband's character and past abuse. He raised concerns regarding conflicting evidence, such as the fact that the Applicant described her husband as a "conservative" and "fundamentalist" Muslim. Yet, she also stated that he drank, gambled, womanized, and allowed her to work and run a taxi business.
[12]
The Officer also reviewed the Applicant's and her family's evidence regarding the threatening phone calls her ex-husband had made. The Officer noted that the evidence of the Applicant and her family differed regarding the frequency of the calls. The Officer also noted that the Applicant stated that she and her sister had gone to the RCMP and the police regarding the phone calls, but no objective evidence of this was provided by the Applicant. The Officer also noted that the Applicant had stated that her ex-husband had threatened to come to Canada to harm her and her children, but there was no evidence to indicate that he had attempted to do so in the four years that the Applicant has been in Canada. The Officer also noted that there was no evidence that the ex-husband had attempted to bring the children back to Sweden through legal means, even though the Applicant and her ex-husband had joint custody of the children.
[13]
The Officer then outlined the objective third-party evidence that supported the Applicant's case. This evidence included two documents from the Swedish Tax Agency showing that the Applicant and her husband were divorced in 2001 and that they were no longer living together and a notarized statement from the ex-husband allowing the Applicant to travel out of Sweden with the children. The Officer contrasted this evidence with the statements of the Applicant and her family and stated that:
... Taken individually, the noted discrepancies and implausibilities with the stated facts of the applicant's case may be insignificant. However, taken as a whole, and in the context of physical evidence which reasonably indicates the ex-husband's compliance and assistance, I find insufficient persuasive evidence that, on a balance of probabilities, the applicant and her children face an ongoing or forward-looking personalized risk from her ex-husband.
[14]
The Officer also noted that the Applicant has a scar on her arm that she claims was a result of abuse. The Officer acknowledges that it is possible that the scar resulted from abuse, despite a lack of objective evidence. However, overall, the Officer found that there was insufficient evidence of a current or future risk to the Applicant and her children.
[15]
The Officer found that even if the ex-husband presented a risk to the Applicant, particularly in light of the psychological report on the Applicant's daughter, the protection that can be provided in Sweden diminishes any hardship and perceived risk. The Officer reviewed the US Department of State Country Report for Sweden and finds that there are many measures in place that can provide protection for the Applicant and her children. The Officer acknowledged that the existence of state protection is not determinative in an application based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds in the same manner as in a pre-removal risk assessment. However, the Officer found that the level of protection that can be provided in Sweden as a highly developed democratic state significantly mitigated any potential risk that the Applicant faced if she returned to Sweden.
[16]
The Officer thus concluded that although he acknowledged that it would be difficult for the Applicant to leave her family and return to Sweden, the difficulty did not amount to unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship. The Officer also concluded that there was no unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship caused by a personalized risk, and therefore there were insufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds to approve the application for exemption.
Relevant Legislation
[17]
The relevant statutory provisions are contained in Appendix A at the end of this document.
Issues
[18]
The Applicant has raised the following issues, restated below:
a. Did the Officer err in failing to adequately address the best interests of the children?
b. Did the Officer breach the duty of procedural fairness owed to the Applicants by making findings regarding the credibility of the principal Applicant without affording her the opportunity to respond to the Officer's concerns?
c. Did the Officer err in failing to adequately address the hardship that would be faced by the Applicants based on the risk posed by the principal Applicant's ex-husband?
d. Did the Officer err by incorrectly finding that the applicable removal order against the Applicants is a one-year exclusion order?
e. Did the Officer err by failing to refer to evidence obtained from the Swedish government that the child Applicants cannot obtain travel documents to Sweden without first getting permission from their father and by failing to disclose this evidence to the Applicants?
[19]
The application for judicial review shall be dismissed for the following reasons.
Standard of Review
[20]
The Applicant submits that according the Supreme Court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), there are two standards of review: correctness and reasonableness. The Applicant alleges that questions of law are reviewed on a correctness standard, and questions of fact or mixed fact and law are reviewed on a standard of reasonableness. The Applicant further contends, relying on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.T.R. 280 that a breach of procedural fairness is an error in law and thus the applicable standard of review is correctness.
[21]
The Respondent argues that the applicable standard of review of a decision with respect to a humanitarian and compassionate application is reasonableness, which is concerned with justification, transparency and intelligibility, falling within the range of acceptable outcomes defensible on the facts and in law. The Respondent relies on a number of cases for this proposition:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[22]
I agree that <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> sets out the applicable standards of review. I also agree with both the Applicant and the Respondent: questions of procedural fairness deserve no deference and are reviewed on a correctness standard, while other questions relating to the reasons of the Officer on a humanitarian and compassionate application involve discretion, which deserves deference, and are assessed on a standard of reasonableness. Thus, the standard of review for the first and third issues is reasonableness, and the standard of review for the second, fourth and fifth issues is correctness.
Analysis
Did the Officer err in failing to adequately address the best interests of the children?
[23]
In determining the best interests of the child, I agree with the Applicant that
Baker
provides guidance to the officers, requiring that they be alert, alive and sensitive to the best interests of the children and that their interests not be minimized. However, I do not agree that the Court's decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.T.R. 229 provides any further guidance. The Federal Court of Appeal held in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] F.C.J. No. 713 (QL) that the analysis of the best interests of the child in
Gill
was
... undeniably wrong and should not be followed. The consideration of a child's best interests in an immigration context does not readily lend itself to a family law analysis where the true issues are those of custody and access to children. Contrary to family law cases where "the best interests of the children" are, it goes without saying, the determining factor, it is not so in immigration cases, where the issue is, as in the case before us, whether a child should be exempted from the requirements of the Act and its Regulations and allowed to become a permanent resident. As Décary J.A. made clear in his Reasons for the majority in Hawthorne, supra, the principle which this Court enunciated in Legault supra, is that although the best interests of a child are an important factor, they are not determinative of the issue before the officer.
[24]
Therefore,
Gill
offers no additional guidance, as family law principles are of no use in the immigration context. An officer must be alert, alive and sensitive to the best interests of the children; he need not treat it as a determinative factor.
[25]
In light of this determination, I do not find the Officer's decision regarding the best interests of the children to be unreasonable. The Officer identified all the relevant factors and discussed them in relation to other factors. The Officer does note that the psychological reports of the Applicant's child does cause concern, but does not reach the level of humanitarian and compassionate grounds. I do not find anything in the Officer's decision to indicate that he did not consider all the relevant issues and weigh them accordingly.
Did the Officer breach the duty of procedural fairness owed to the Applicants by making findings regarding the credibility of the principal Applicant without affording her the opportunity to respond to the Officer's concerns?
[26]
I do not find that the Officer breached procedural fairness in this case. As the Respondent submits, there is no requirement to conduct an interview or an oral hearing. On humanitarian and compassionate applications, the content of the duty of fairness is quite low. All that is required, according to the Supreme Court in
Baker
, above is that the Applicant had the opportunity for "meaningful participation."
[27]
I find that in this case, the Applicant had meaningful participation. She was allowed to make written submissions regarding her fear of returning to Sweden and any other matters that she considered relevant for the determination of her humanitarian and compassionate application. The Officer then weighed the evidence and considered it appropriately.
[28]
The Applicant argues that the Officer made credibility findings and disregarded her sworn affidavit because of supposed inconsistencies. While I do agree with the Applicant that the Officer was not to make adverse credibility findings when the Applicant's credibility had not previously been questioned, I do not agree that the Officer has made credibility findings in this case. The Officer noted discrepancies between the different sources of information and reviewed all the submissions. He then concluded:
... Taken individually, the noted discrepancies and implausibilities with the stated facts of the applicant's case may be insignificant. However, taken as a whole, and in the context of physical evidence which reasonably indicates the ex-husband's compliance and assistance, I find insufficient persuasive evidence that, on a balance of probabilities, the applicant and her children face an ongoing or forward-looking personalized risk from her ex-husband.
[29]
The Officer did not dispute the fact that the Applicant was subject to abuse or that she has a legitimate fear of her husband. The Officer merely concludes, based on all the evidence before him, that there is no personalized risk from the ex-husband that meets the level of unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship. I find this conclusion to be a result of the weighing of evidence in light of all the circumstances and submissions before him, not a conclusion regarding the credibility of the Applicant or the reliability of her sworn affidavit.
[30]
I also do not accept the Applicant's argument that the Officer was required to allow her to make additional submissions regarding the lack of sponsorship. The Applicant relies on Chapter 5 of the Inland Processing Manual (IP 5). In
Baker
, the Supreme Court found that ministerial guidelines were:
... a useful indicator of what constitutes a reasonable interpretation of the power conferred by the section, and the fact that this decision was contrary to their directives is of great help in assessing whether the decision was an unreasonable exercise of the H & C power.
[31]
The guidelines, however, are not binding on an officer. In
Mittal (Litigation Guardian of) v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1998), 147 F.T.R. 285, the Federal Court held:
... Guidelines, of course, must be used with care. They can serve as " 'general policy, or 'rough rules of thumb' " to structure the discretion conferred upon the visa officer. Guidelines, however, should not fetter the visa officer's exercise of discretion by crystallizing into binding and conclusive rules. ...
[32]
The Manual stipulates that officers should allow additional submissions on the lack of sponsorship in cases where the application is based on reunification of relatives or applicants with family relationships. In this case, the Applicant's humanitarian and compassionate application was based primarily on personalized risk from the ex-husband, not on the reunification of family members.
[33]
Also, the Officer only makes one mention of the lack of sponsorship in his decision:
... However, I note that no member of the applicant's family has submitted a sponsorship and it appears that they are and have been (since February 2006) unable or unwilling to support the applicant financially, despite specific statements to the contrary. ...
[34]
There is nothing in the reasons of the Officer to indicate that the finding regarding sponsorship was given any significant weight that affected the Officer's findings regarding establishment or family connectedness. In light of this, I do not find that the Officer committed a reviewable error by failing to provide the Applicant an opportunity to make additional submissions regarding the lack of sponsorship.
Did the Officer err in failing to adequately address the hardship that would be faced by the Applicants based on the risk posed by the principal Applicant's ex-husband?
[35]
I find that the Officer's decision regarding hardship was not unreasonable. All relevant evidence was considered and weighed appropriately. The Officer did not reject the Applicant's evidence that she was abused. He only determined that in light of all the evidence, her ex-husband did not impose a personalized risk amounted to unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship. Similarly, the Officer did not determine that the Applicant did not go to the police or to the RCMP. While the Officer noted that the police response seemed unusual, his main determination was that there was not enough evidence before him to determine if the RCMP took any action or if the responses were permissible or legal, and thus the submissions regarding the police should not be given much weight as an unsubstantiated claim.
[36]
Although the Officer did rely on the existence of state protection to mitigate any potential personalized risk, I do not agree that the Officer imported a PRRA analysis. The Officer clearly stated that he understood that the existence of state protection is not determinative of a humanitarian and compassionate application and he consistently speaks of potential hardship due to risk, not of the existence of risk.
[37]
The Applicant has referred to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.T.R. 136, but I have not found this case to be persuasive in the present case. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Court noted that there was absolutely no reference to hardship in the decision of the Officer, only to personalized risk, and thus the Officer applied the wrong test by assessing risk as opposed to hardship. In the case at bar, however, the Officer refers to hardship a number of times and indicates clearly that his discussion regarding state protection was not determinative and was only included as part of an analysis of unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship.
Did the Officer err by incorrectly finding that the applicable removal order against the Applicants is a one-year exclusion order?
[38]
Section 229 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations
, SOR/2002-227 (the Regulations) outlines the removal orders applicable to particular situations. Paragraph 229(1)(
n
) is applicable to the Applicant, which states:
229. (1)
Paragraph 45(d) of the Act - applicable removal order
For the purposes of paragraph 45(
d
) of the Act, the applicable removal order to be made by the Immigration Division against a person is
[. . . . .]
(
n
) an exclusion order, if they are inadmissible under paragraph 41(
a
) of the Act for any other failure to comply with the Act, unless subsection (2) or (3) applies.
229. (1)
Application de l'alinéa 45d) de la Loi: mesures de renvoi applicables
Pour l'application de l'alinéa 45
d
) de la Loi, la Section de l'immigration prend contre la personne la mesure de renvoi indiquée en regard du motif en cause:
[. . . . .]
n
) en cas d'interdiction de territoire au titre de l'article 41 de la Loi pour tout autre manquement à la Loi, l'exclusion, à moins que les paragraphes (2) ou (3) ne s'appliquent.
[39]
Section 229(2) states:
229. (2)
Eligible claim for refugee protection - If a claim for refugee protection is made and the claim has been determined to be eligible to be referred to the Refugee Protection Division or no determination has been made, a departure order is the applicable removal order in the circumstances set out in paragraph (1)(
f
), (
g
), (
j
), (
m
), or (
n
).
229. (2)
Demande d'asile recevable - Dans le cas d'une demande d'asile jugée recevable ou à l'égard de laquelle il n'a pas été statué sur la recevabilité, la mesure de renvoi à prendre dans les circonstances prévues aux alinéas (1)
f
),
g
),
j
),
m
) ou
n
) est l'interdiction de séjour.
[40]
In this case, the Applicant is being removed because her temporary visitor visa has expired. This would fall under paragraph 229(1)(
n
) of the Regulations. Although the Applicant applied for refugee status, she was found to be ineligible to apply. As a result, subsection 229(2) does not apply to the Applicant, as it only applies to those who have an eligible claim for refugee protection. The applicable order was an exclusion order.
[41]
As for the Applicant's children, they were eligible to claim refugee status, but their claim was denied. Thus, under subsection 229(2), the applicable order was a departure order.
[42]
Section 229(3) goes on, stating:
229(3)
Exception - The applicable removal order in the circumstances set out in paragraph (1)(
f
), (
g
), (
h
), (
j
), (
l
) or (
n
) is a deportation order if the person
[. . . . .]
(b) has failed to comply with any condition or obligation imposed under the Act or the
Immigration Act
, chapter I-2 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985, unless the failure is the basis for the removal order; [...]

), la mesure de renvoi à prendre dans les cas ci-après est l'expulsion:
[. . . . .]
b) outre le manquement sur lequel la mesure de renvoi se fonde, il ne s'est pas conformé aux conditions et obligations qui lui ont été imposées aux termes de la Loi ou de la Loi sur l'immigration, chapitre I-2 des Lois révisées du Canada (1985); [...]
[43]
For the reasons discussed previously, the order applicable to the Applicant is an exclusion order. She is not a failed refugee claimant, so the Applicant's submissions regarding failed refugee claimants do not apply to the Applicant.
[44]
The children, however, are subject to a departure order as failed refugee claimants, so the submissions regarding failed refugee claimants are applicable. However, the Applicant's submissions regarding a removal order against a failed refugee claimant are also wrong. Under paragraph 49(2)(
c
) of the Act, a removal order does not become enforceable until 15 days after notification that the claim has been rejected has been received by the claimants. Once the notification is received, subsection 224(2) states that the person subject to a departure order then has 30 days to leave Canada or the departure order becomes a deportation order.
[45]
In light of these conclusions, I do not find that the Officer was wrong in stating that the applicable order against the Applicant was an exclusion order. The Officer's analysis regarding the hardship faced by being separated from family is also not unreasonable.
Did the Officer err by failing to refer to evidence obtained from the Swedish government that the child Applicants cannot obtain travel documents to Sweden without first getting permission from their father and by failing to disclose this evidence to the Applicants?
[46]
There was no requirement to disclose information that was already known to the Applicant. While it is not binding on the Officer, IP 5 states that extrinsic information is:
i. Information that is from a source other than the applicant; and
ii. Information that the applicant does not have access to or is not aware of and is being used in the decision.
[47]
The letter from the Swedish government is extrinsic evidence in that the information was from a source other than the Applicant. However, the Applicant was clearly aware that her ex-husband's permission was required in order to travel with the children as she has already obtained such permission in order to travel to Canada. There is no evidence that the permission already obtained is insufficient for the children to return to Sweden. Also, the evidence was not relied on as part of the Officer's decision, as he does not cite or source the letter in question. The Federal Court stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] F.C.J. No. 974 (QL) ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) at paragraph 33:
In the context of an H&C application, there is no duty to disclose documents where an officer does not rely on extrinsic evidence prepared by a third party; correspondingly, there is no obligation to provide the affected individual with an opportunity to respond (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) (C.A.) at para. 26).
[48]
The Officer did not err in failing to refer to the evidence in his decision. An officer is not required to make reference to every piece of evidence before him. There is a presumption that the Officer properly considered all the evidence that had been presented ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 23). In addition to the letter from the Swedish government, the Officer also had evidence that the Applicant knew that she was required to obtain permission from her ex-husband because she had already done so once before. Thus, I do not find that a failure to refer to the evidence or to disclose it to the Applicant constitutes an error of law in this case.
[49]
No questions for certification were proposed and none arise in this case.
JUDGMENT

the application for judicial review be dismissed. No question is certified.
