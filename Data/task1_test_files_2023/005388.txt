McNair, J.
: This is an appeal from a decision of the Registrar of Trademarks dated April 7, 1981, refusing to expunge or amend Imperial Tobacco's trademark CAMBRIDGE used in association with a brand of its cigarettes, pursuant to a notice given by the appellant under s. 44(1) of the Trade Marks Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. T-10.
[2]
The trademark was registered by Tuckett Tobacco Company on November 15, 1933. The respondent acquired title to CAMBRIDGE Registration No. 267/57319 from Imasco Limited on October 27, 1978. As of December 31, 1971, Imperial was recorded as a registered user of Registration No. 267/57319. On July 30, 1980, the solicitors for the appellant, Philip Morris Incorporated, gave a notice under s. 44(1) of the Act calling upon the respondent, Imperial Tobacco Limited, to furnish within three months:
"... an affidavit or statutory declaration showing with respect to each of the wares or services specified in the registration, whether the trademark is in use in Canada and, if not, the date when it was last so in use and the reason for the absence of such use since such date."
[3]
The only evidence furnished in the proceeding before the Registrar was the affidavit of the Secretary of Imperial Tobacco, Roland Bouchard, sworn on October 16, 1980, wherein the affiant deposes, inter alia, as follows:
"5. THAT since December 31, 1971, Imperial has in the usual course of its business and trade, first as a registered user and then as owner of CAMBRIDGE registration No. 267/57319, continuously offered for sale and sold in Canada cigarettes in packages that prominently display the word CAMBRIDGE thereon.
"6. THAT the word CAMBRIDGE has appeared and continues to appear on cigarette packages as aforesaid for the purpose of distinguishing cigarettes manufactured by Imperial from those manufactured and sold by others.
"7. THAT marked Exhibit 'A' to this my affidavit is a specimen comprising a cigarette package of the type referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6 above.
"8. THAT Exhibit 'A' is representative of the packaging used by Imperial to sell its CAMBRIDGE cigarettes since 1971.
"9. THAT marked Exhibit 'B' to this my affidavit is a copy of an invoice evidencing a representative sale of, inter alia, CAMBRIDGE cigarettes as aforesaid to Hudsons Bay Wholesale in Regina, Saskatchewan. The invoice indicates that the said CAMBRIDGE cigarettes were delivered to Hudsons Bay Wholesale on June 20, 1980.
"10. THAT Hudsons Bay Wholesale sells cigarettes and tobacco products to retail outlets in the Regina area, including a retail outlet known as the 'Smoke Shoppe' located in the Eaton-Dominion Mall, Regina.
"11. THAT marked Exhibit 'C' to this my affidavit is a copy of an invoice dated July 8, 1980, of Hudsons Bay Wholesale evidencing the sale by it to the said 'Smoke Shoppe' of Imperial's said CAMBRIDGE cigarettes.
"12. THAT CAMBRIDGE cigarettes are now, were on August 1, 1980, and were prior to August 1, 1980, being displayed, offered for sale, and sold at retail by the said 'Smoke Shoppe' in the Eaton-Dominion Mall in Regina."
[4]
The Registrar heard the representations, canvassed the facts, reviewed the authorities, and reached the following conclusion:
"Certainly, in the present case, I can conclude that a commercial transaction did occur shortly prior to the date of the section 44 notice involving the registrant's wares bearing the trademark CAMBRIDGE which, taken in conjunction with Mr. Bouchard's statement relating to continuous use of the trademark CAMBRIDGE in Canada in the usual course of business and trade, is such that I can conclude that the trademark CAMBRIDGE was in use in the normal course of trade in Canada as of the date of the section 44 notice ..."
[5]
A notice of appeal from this decision was filed by the appellant on June 8, 1981. There was no cross-appeal. The Registrar did not contest the appeal. The respondent proffered as further evidence in the appeal a second affidavit of Roland Bouchard, sworn June 30, 1981 and the affidavit of one Dean Smith, sworn July 8, 1981.
[6]
The second Bouchard affidavit deposed in paragraphs 3 and 4 thereof as follows:
"3. THAT it has been drawn to my attention that there is an error in paragraph 9 of my aforesaid affidavit. In particular, the invoice that is marked Exhibit 'B' to my aforesaid affidavit relates to a transaction whereby CAMBRIDGE cigarettes were delivered to the Smoke Shoppe, rather than to Hudsons Bay Wholesale. The CAMBRIDGE cigarettes referred to in Exhibit 'B' were delivered to the Smoke Shoppe on June 20, 1980, by a sales representative of Imperial Tobacco Limited. Thereafter, as shown by Exhibit 'C' to my aforesaid affidavit, Hudsons Bay Wholesale invoiced the Smoke Shoppe for the said CAMBRIDGE cigarettes on July 8, 1980.
"4. THAT in the usual course of Imperial Tobacco Limited's business and trade, it has a number of sales representatives who visit retail outlets with a view to ensuring that the said outlets have an adequate supply of Imperial Tobacco Limited's products. In the event that a retail outlet is found to be in short supply of any particular product, the sales representative will frequently arrange for a delivery of that product on the basis that Imperial Tobacco Limited will thereafter bill its wholesaler, who will in turn bill the retailer in respect of that delivery. The invoices that are marked Exhibits 'B' and 'C' to my aforesaid affidavit are typical of such transaction."
[7]
The body of the Dean Smith affidavit reads as follows:
"1. THAT I am owner of a retail tobacconist known as Jade's Smokers Corner doing business in the Eaton-Dominion Mall in the City of Regina.
"2. THAT Jade's Smokers Corner was until May 13th, 1981, known as the 'Smoke Shoppe'.
"3. THAT I have held my aforesaid position with Jade's Smokers Corner and the Smoke Shoppe since May, 1979.
"4. THAT the said Smoke Shoppe (now Jade's Smokers Corner) in the ordinary course of its business offers for sale and sells at retail, inter alia, a number of brands of cigarettes manufactured by a number of companies, including those manufactured by Imperial Tobacco Limited.
"5. THAT one brand of cigarette offered for sale and sold by the said Smoke Shoppe (now Jade's Smokers Corner) as aforesaid is Imperial Tobacco Limited's CAMBRIDGE cigarettes.
"6. THAT the said Smoke Shoppe (now Jade's Smokers Corner) purchases CAMBRIDGE cigarettes, as well as a number of other brands, through wholesale suppliers such as Hudsons Bay Wholesale. Although the Smoke Shoppe (now Jade's Smokers Corner) is invoiced for such purchases by its wholesale suppliers, the cigarettes that are the subject matter of such invoices may be delivered by a representative of the manufacturer, rather than the wholesaler.
"7. THAT to my knowledge CAMBRIDGE cigarettes have been continually offered for sale and sold at retail at the said Smoke Shoppe (now Jade's Smokers Corner) since at least as early as July 17, 1979, and in particular CAMBRIDGE cigarettes were begin offered for sale and sold as aforesaid in the period immediately preceding July 30, 1980, and on July 30, 1980. Since July 30, 1980, CAMBRIDGE cigarettes have continued to be offered for sale and sold and are at present being offered for sale and sold by the said Jade's Smokers Corner."
[8]
The sole issue on the appeal is whether the trademark CAMBRIDGE was "in use in Canada" within the meaning of s. 44(1) of the Trade Marks Act and the other relevant statutory provisions.
[9]
Section 44(1) of the Act provides as follows:
"44(1) The Registrar may at any time and, at the written request made after three years from the date of the registration by any person who pays the prescribed fee shall, unless he sees good reason to the contrary, give notice to the registered owner requiring him to furnish within three months an affidavit or statutory declaration showing with respect to each of the wares or services specified in the registration, whether the trademark is in use in Canada and, if not, the date when it was last so in use and the reason for the absence of such use since such date."
[10]
Section 2 of the Act defines "use" as follows:
"'use' in relation to a trademark, means any use that by section 4 is deemed to be a use in association with wares or services."
[11]
Section 4(1) reads:
"4(1) A trademark is deemed to be used in association with wares if, at the time of the transfer of the property in or possession of such wares, in the normal course of trade, it is marked on the wares themselves or on the packages in which they are distributed or it is in any other manner so associated with the wares that notice of the association is then given to the person to whom the property or possession is transferred."
[12]
It is well established that the purpose and scope of s. 44 is to provide a simple, summary and expeditious procedure for clearing the register of trademarks which are not bona fide claimed by their owners as active trademarks. The procedure has been aptly described as one for removing "deadwood" from the register. The section does not contemplate a determination on the issue of abandonment but rather simply places on the registered owner of the trademark the onus of furnishing evidence of use in Canada or of special circumstances excusing nonuser. The Registrar's decision is not one that finally determines substantive rights but only whether the trademark entry is liable to be expunged under s. 44 or not. If user is relied on then the evidence filed in response to the notice must "show" the use or at least sufficiently relate the facts from which such use can be inferred. Mere statutory tracking in the nature of a bare statement that the registrant was currently using the trademark in the normal course of trade in association with the wares is insufficient to establish user unless coupled with facts that are descriptively corroborative of the same. Evidence of a single sale, whether wholesale or retail, in the normal course of trade may well suffice so long as it follows the pattern of a genuine commercial transaction and is not seen as being deliberately manufactured or contrived to protect the registration of the trademark. Evidence in response to a s. 44 notice should be forthcoming in quality, not quantity, and there is no need nor justification for evidentiary overkill.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 62 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 136 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.); and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.).
[13]
The appellant contends that the affidavit evidence of the respondent is defective in several respects with the result that the respondent failed to meet the onus of establishing on balance of probability that the trademark CAMBRIDGE was in use in Canada. Firstly, it is submitted that there is no evidence that the Smoke Shoppe ever ordered the four cartons of CAMBRIDGE cigarettes. In other words, there was no specific order for four cartons of CAMBRIDGE cigarettes from the retail shop to the owner of the trademark, Imperial Tobacco, and delivery by the latter pursuant to such order, thereby constituting a completed contract. This appears to have been the view of a normal commercial transaction taken by Gibson, J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The decision in that case seems to have turned on the fact that the affidavit evidence of use in Canada was seen as unreliable. In my view, subsequent authorities have extended the meaning of the words "normal course of trade" in s. 4 of the Act beyond the narrow parameters of the Molson case.
[14]
Rouleau, J., put it this way in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  long as the sale is made in the normal course of trade as defined by s. 4 of the Act. It has also been established that the words 'normal course of trade' recognize the continuity of a transaction from the manufacturer to the ultimate consumer and provide protection for the manufacturer's trademark throughout these intervening transactions ..."
[15]
Counsel for the appellant contends that evidence of sales after the date of the notice on July 13, 1980, was totally irrelevant. There are only passing references in the affidavits of Roland Bouchard and Dean Smith to the sale of CAMBRIDGE cigarettes after July 30, 1980 and the affidavit averments, as I see them, are primarily directed to the single sale occurring before that date in the context of its overall commercial attributes. It is now settled that the question whether a trademark is in use in Canada within the meaning of s. 44(1) must be decided upon the interpretation of its relevant statutory provisions, one of which is that evidence of use is not limited to use immediately prior to the notice date.
[16]
Stone, J., stated this opinion in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  evidence of use be limited to use made on or immediately prior to the notice date. It only requires that, within the specified time-limit, the registered owner furnish an affidavit or statutory declaration 'showing with respect to each of the wares or services specified in the registration, whether the trademark is in use in Canada'."
[17]
In the present case, the affidavit evidence furnished by the registrant is sufficient, in my view, to establish a sale in the normal course of trade. The commercial transaction in this instance involved delivery of the four cartons of CAMBRIDGE cigarettes by the owner to the customer on July 20, 1980 and the concurrent invoicing of the same by the owner to the wholesaler and the wholesaler to the customer. Moreover, the evidence does not indicate that the sale lacked bona fides in the sense of being deliberately manufactured or contrived in an attempt to protect the registration of the trademark rather than to establish its genuine use in the normal course of trade. The appellant's arguments on these points must therefore fail.
[18]
Counsel for the appellant also objects that the first affidavit of Mr. Bouchard is inadmissible by reason that the evidence of the Smoke Shoppe sale in Regina must be taken to have been based on hearsay, rather than firsthand knowledge. Counsel submits that this inference must be drawn from the fact that Mr. Bouchard resides in Montreal. How could the deponent relate the circumstances of a sale that took place in Regina, except on the basis of secondhand knowledge? Given that the first Bouchard affidavit may not present itself, at first sight, as an affidavit of belief, counsel contends that it must nevertheless be regarded as not being "confined to such facts as the witness is able of his own knowledge to prove" within the meaning of rule 332(1). Counsel for the respondent took the position that a court should not be too quick to dismiss affidavit evidence as hearsay on the mere speculation of counsel that the affidavit was not confined to facts based on firsthand, personal knowledge. He contended in the alternative that any evidentiary gaps in the Bouchard affidavit were outweighed by the Dean Smith affidavit and the evidence in its entirety.
[19]
The Bouchard affidavit is not replete with statements made on information and belief nor do the statements therein clearly manifest any flagrant lack of personal knowledge. Under the circumstances and from the fact that the alleged hearsay defect was not raised as a specific ground of appeal, it would be wrong, in my view, to treat the affidavit as being inadmissible. It seems to me on balance that Mr. Bouchard was manifestly in a position from the standpoint of his office and experience with the respondent "to know whereof he deposed":  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , per Mahoney, J., at pp. 59-60. In my opinion, the evidence in its entirety is sufficient to establish the sale of the four cartons of cigarettes to the retail tobacco outlet in Regina.
[20]
The appellant's main argument is that the isolated sale of four cartons of cigarettes to one tobacco outlet in Regina does not establish use of the trademark in association with the wares in the normal course of trade. The appellant relies heavily on  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  contention. [Now reported 7 F.T.R. 54].
[21]
In the Plough case, the Federal Court of Appeal expunged the trademark on the ground that the affidavit evidence failed to meet the requirement of s. 44(1) of "showing" the use of the trademark within the meaning of ss. 2 and 4 of the Act. The evidence found to be defective consisted of nothing more than the bare statement that the registrant was currently using the trademark in the normal course of trade in Canada in association with the pharmaceutical wares. This fact alone distinguishes that authority from the case at bar.
[22]
Counsel for the appellant contends that the Sim & McBurney case, is clear authority for the proposition that evidence of use in the normal course of trade must contain information as to the volume and type of sales and the numbers and location of purchasers. In that case, the registrant in response to a s. 44 notice submitted the affidavit of its vice-president evidencing three sales of its clothing wares, but leaving much to be desired in the way of detailed particulars. The affidavit nowhere attested to the fact that these sales were made "in the normal course of trade". Mr. Justice Strayer pointed out that while the presence of such a statement would not be sufficient of itself to establish the normal course of trade it would have represented the beginning of compliance with the requirements of s. 44. He considered that the serious problem in Sim & McBurney was the insufficiency of the affidavit in failing to describe the precise nature of the trade carried on by the registrant, thereby precluding the court from drawing any inference that the sales were made in the normal course of trade. It was in this context that he made the statement regarding the deficiency of information as to volume of sales and numbers and location of purchasers. The learned judge went on to order the expungement of the registration on the ground that the lack of further affidavit evidence clearly enabled him to draw the inference that use had not been shown as required by s. 44 of the Act.
[23]
In my view the present case is distinguishable from Sim & McBurney in several important respects. As previously indicated, there was nothing in the supporting affidavit in Sim & McBurney to link the sales to normal course of trade transactions. In contrast, the first Bouchard affidavit deposes in paragraph 5 that Imperial Tobacco had continuously sold CAMBRIDGE cigarettes in Canada since December 31, 1971 "in the usual course of its business and trade". The case of Sim & McBurney, like Plough, is further distinguishable by the fact that the affidavit in response to the s. 44 notice makes nothing more than the bare statement that the trademark was in use in Canada and fails to show the facts establishing such use. Small wonder that such evidence was held to be inadequate. In contrast, the affidavit evidence in the case at bar, as I have found, adequately establishes a sale in the normal course of trade within the meaning of the statute.
[24]
Essentially, the only question is whether evidence of a single sale will suffice. I am of the opinion that evidence of a single sale is sufficient to establish the use of a trademark in the normal course of trade depending upon the circumstances surrounding the transaction, provided the evidence was not manufactured for the sole and deliberate purpose of protecting the trademark registration: see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , per Cattanach, J., at p. 55;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , per Thurlow, A.C.J., at pp. 62-63. Consequently, I reject the appellant's argument on the point of volume of sales.
[25]
The final issue is whether the Registrar of Trademarks was right or wrong in reaching the decision he did upon the evidence before him. The appeal is under s. 56 of the Trade Marks Act and there is no question that additional evidence may be adduced by affidavit beyond that adduced before the Registrar. Two additional affidavits were adduced in this case. Counsel for the appellant argues accordingly that this constitutes the appeal a trial de novo and enables me to overrule the Registrar of Trademarks by substituting my opinion for his, without regard to the weight to be attached to his decision. At least that is how I understand the argument. I must disagree. An appeal is not a trial de novo in the strict sense of that term. While the court may exercise any discretion vested in the Registrar, it should be circumspect about interfering with his decision unless it is reasonably apparent that the Registrar had gone wrong. I am satisfied that the evidence supports the Registrar's conclusion and that the decision was not based upon a wrong principle.
[26]
For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent.
Appeal dismissed.
