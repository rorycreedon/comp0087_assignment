Kelen, J.
: This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Immigration Appeal Division, of the Immigration and Refugee Board ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), which dismissed the applicant's appeal against the refusal to issue permanent residence visas to the applicant's sons, pursuant to subsection 117(9)(d) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations
, SOR/2002-227 ("
Regulations
").
[2]
The case involves the right of a Canadian citizen to sponsor members of her family whom she concealed when she immigrated to Canada. Subsection 117(9)(d) of the
Regulations
excludes from the family class eligible for sponsorship, family members not disclosed, and therefore examined, when the sponsor immigrated. The applicant submits that subsection 117(9)(d) of the
Regulations
is:
(1) inoperative since it is contrary to section 7 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
, Part 1 of the
Constitution Act, 1982
, being Schedule B to the
Canada Act, 1982 (U.K.)
, 1982, c. 11; and,
(2) ultra vires the family reunification objective of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the "
Act
"), and requirement that the
Act
be construed in accordance with Canada's international human rights obligations.
Sponsorship Application
[3]
In July 2001 the applicant applied to sponsor her two sons' applications for permanent residence, as members of the family class. The application was refused by a visa officer in April 2003 on the basis that the sons cannot be considered members of the family class because the applicant had not disclosed them when she had made her application for permanent residence to Canada in 1990. For this reason, the two sons were excluded from the family class under subsection 117(9)(d) of
IRP Regulations
. Subsection 117(9) of the
Regulations
excludes certain relationships from the family class, and reads as follows:
"Excluded relationships
"(9) No foreign national may be considered a member of the family class by virtue of their relationship to a sponsor if
. . . . .
(d) the sponsor previously made an application for permanent residence and became a permanent resident and, at the time of that application, the foreign national was a non-accompanying family member or a former spouse or former common-law partner of the sponsor and was not examined."
"Restrictions
"(9) Ne sont pas considérées comme appartenant à la catégorie du regroupement familial du fait de leur relation avec le répondant les personnes suivantes:
. . . . .
d) dans le cas où le répondant est devenu résident permanent à la suite d'une demande à cet effet, l'étranger qui, à l'époque où cette demande a été faite, n'a pas fait l'objet d'un contrôle et était un membre de la famille du répondant n'accompagnant pas ce dernier ou était un ex-époux ou ancien conjoint de fait du répondant."
This decision of the visa officer was appealed to the IAD.
Appeal to the IAD
[4]
On September 26, 2003, the IAD dismissed the applicant's appeal on the grounds that the visa officer had not made an error, and that the IAD lacks jurisdiction to consider humanitarian and compassionate grounds unless a foreign national and sponsor fall within the family class, as described in the
Regulations
. The IAD's decision states:
"The appeal is dismissed because the appellant has not shown that the visa officer's refusal was wrong in law. On the basis of the information provided, the person who was sponsored by the appellant is not a member of the family class. Therefore, under s. 65 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, the IAD has no discretionary jurisdiction to consider humanitarian and compassionate considerations. The appellant's two sons, Jay MONTIADORA and Jayson MONTIADORA were not disclosed and hence not examined." (emphasis in original)
[5]
Section 63 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, S.C. 2001, c. 27 ("
IRPA
") provides the right to appeal a visa refusal, in the family class, to the IAD as follows:
"63(1) A person who has filed in the prescribed manner an application to sponsor a foreign national as a member of the family class may appeal to the Immigration Appeal Division against a decision not to issue the foreign national a permanent resident visa."
"63(1) Quiconque a déposé, conformément au règlement, une demande de parrainage au titre du regroupement familial peut interjeter appel du refus de délivrer le visa de résident permanent."
[6]
Section 65 of
IRPA
bars the IAD from considering humanitarian and compassionate grounds except where foreign nationals and sponsors fall within the family class, as follows:
"65. In an appeal under subsection 63(1) or (2) respecting an application based on membership in the family class, the Immigration Appeal Division may not consider humanitarian and compassionate considerations unless it has decided that the foreign national is a member of the family class and that their sponsor is a sponsor within the meaning of the regulations."
"65. Dans le cas de l'appel visé aux paragraphes 63(1) ou (2) d'une décision portant sur une demande au titre du regroupement familial, les motifs d'ordre humanitaire ne peuvent être pris en considération que s'il a été statué que l'étranger fait bien partie de cette catégorie et que le répondant a bien la qualité réglementaire."
Affidavit Evidence
[7]
The
Federal Court Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules
, SOR/2002-232 allows the applicant to file an affidavit verifying the facts relied upon in support of the application. The respondent has the right to cross-examine the applicant on such an affidavit. The applicant chose to file such an affidavit. The facts in the affidavit and cross-examination are properly before the Court and can be considered by the Court to the extent they are relevant. I find that these facts are relevant with respect to the three legal questions in issue. These facts are useful to demonstrate the purpose of the relevant provisions of the law, and the abuses which can take place. These facts are pertinent to the equities of the case, in particular to the applicability of the compassionate and humanitarian considerations, taking into account the best interests of the children. Moreover, these facts may be important for the Court understanding whether certifying questions of law would likely be dispositive of an exemption for the applicant from subsection 117(9)(d) of the
Regulations
.
The Facts
[8]
The applicant, a Canadian citizen, was born in the Philippines on December 30, 1957. She was admitted to Canada as a permanent resident in 1993.
[9]
In 1990, the applicant had been sponsored by her mother, who was in Canada. At that time, the
Immigration Regulations
provided that the applicant could be sponsored by her mother if she was "an unmarried daughter" of a Canadian citizen or permanent resident.
[10]
When the applicant applied for permanent residence in Canada, she stated that she was single and had no children. However, when she was medically examined for immigration purposes, the doctor said that it was apparent that she had given birth to a child. At that point, the applicant revised her application for permanent residence to state that she did have one child, a daughter born on May 20, 1986.
[11]
In 2001 the applicant, by now a Canadian citizen, applied to sponsor two sons as Canadian immigrants. The birth certificates of the two sons were filed in support of the application. The birth certificates state that the applicant is married to Mr. Jayson Montiadora in the Philippines and that he is the father of the applicant's two sons -- Jay, born October 14, 1983, and Jayson born February 11, 1985. The evidence before this Court is that one of the sons now has a child of his own.
Issues
[12]
The applicant submits that subsection 117(9)(d) of the
Immigration Refugee Protection Regulations
is invalid for the following reasons:
(i) it is ultra vires subsection 12(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
;
(ii) it is ultra vires paragraph 3(3)(f) of
IRPA
as it does not comply with Canada's international human rights obligations; and,
(iii) it is unconstitutional as it deprives the applicant her right to liberty and/or right to security of the person, in a manner not in accordance with principles of fundamental justice, contrary to section 7 of the
Charter
.
The Statutory Scheme Under IRPA for Sponsoring a Family Member
[13]
Subsection 12(1) of
IRPA
provides a foreign national may be selected as a member of the family class on the basis of their relationship as the:
(1) spouse;
(2) common-law partner;
(3) child;
(4) other prescribed family member
of a Canadian citizen or permanent resident.
[14]
Section 12 of
IPRA
reads as follows:
"Family reunification
"12(1) A foreign national may be selected as a member of the family class on the basis of their relationship as the spouse, common-law partner, child, parent or other prescribed family member of a Canadian citizen or permanent resident.
"12(2) Economic immigration
"12(2) A foreign national may be selected as a member of the economic class on the basis of their ability to become economically established in Canada.
"12(3) Refugees
"12(3) A foreign national, inside or outside Canada, may be selected as a person who under this Act is a Convention refugee or as a person in similar circumstances, taking into account Canada's humanitarian tradition with respect to the displaced and the persecuted."
"Regroupement familial
"12(1) La sélection des étrangers de la catégorie 'regroupement familial' se fait en fonction de la relation qu'ils ont avec un citoyen canadien ou un résident permanent, à titre d'époux, de conjoint de fait, d'enfant ou de père ou mère ou à titre d'autre membre de la famille prévu par règlement.
"12(2) Immigration économique
"12(2) La sélection des étrangers de la catégorie 'immigration économique' se fait en fonction de leur capacité à réussir leur établissement économique au Canada.
"12(3) Réfugiés
"12(3) La sélection de l'étranger, qu'il soit au Canada ou non, s'effectue, conformément à la tradition humanitaire du Canada à l'égard des personnes déplacées ou persécutées, selon qu'il a la qualité, au titre de la présente loi, de réfugié ou de personne en situation semblable."
[15]
Subsection 13(1) of
IRPA
provides the Canadian citizen or permanent resident may, subject to the
Regulations
, sponsor a foreign national who is a member of the family class.
[16]
Section 13 of
IRPA
reads as follows:
"Right to sponsor family member
"13(1) A Canadian citizen or permanent resident may, subject to the regulations, sponsor a foreign national who is a member of the family class.
"13(2) Group right to sponsor.
"13(2) A group of Canadian citizens or permanent residents, a corporation incorporated under a law of Canada or of a province, and an unincorporated organization or association under federal or provincial law, or any combination of them may, subject to the regulations, sponsor a Convention refugee or a person in similar circumstances.
"13(3) Obligation
"13(3) An undertaking relating to sponsorship is binding on the person who gives it.
"13(4) Instructions of Minister
"13(4) An officer shall apply the regulations on sponsorship referred to in paragraph 14(2)(e) in accordance with any instructions that the Minister may make."
"Droit au parrainage: individus
"13(1) Tout citoyen canadien et tout résident permanent peuvent, sous réserve des règlements, parrainer l'étranger de la catégorie 'regroupement familial' .
"13(2) Droit au parrainage: groupes
"13(2) Tout groupe de citoyens canadiens ou de résidents permanents ou toute personne morale ou association de régime fédéral ou provincial - ou tout groupe de telles de ces personnes -, peut, sous réserve des règlements, parrainer un étranger qui a la qualité, au titre de la présente loi, de réfugié ou de personne en situation semblable.
"13(3) Obligation
"13(3) L'engagement de parrainage lie le répondant.
"13(4) Instructions
"13(4) L'agent est tenu de se conformer aux instructions du ministre sur la mise en oeuvre des règlements visés à l'alinéa 14(2)e)."
[17]
Subsection 14(1) of
IRPA
states that the
Regulations
may provide for any matter relating to "this Division" (this Division includes "the right to sponsor a family class member"), and the
Regulations
may define, for the purposes of
IRPA
, the terms used in this Division.
[18]
Subsection 14(1) of
IRPA
reads as follows:
"Regulations
"14(1) The regulations may provide for any matter relating to the application of this Division, and may define, for the purposes of this Act, the terms used in this Division."
"Application générale
"14(1) Les règlements régissent l'application de la présente section et définissent, pour l'application de la présente loi, les termes qui y sont employés."
[19]
Section 117 of the
Regulations
prescribes the family class and who may be sponsored as members of the family class. Subsection 117(9)(d) prescribes "excluded relationships" from membership in the family class. The pertinent excluded relationship is a non-accompanying family member who was not examined when the sponsor previously made an application for permanent residence and became a permanent resident. Subsection 117(9)(d) excludes relatives of the sponsor from the "family class" whom the sponsor did not disclose, but should have disclosed, when the sponsor made his or her original application for permanent residence.
[20]
Subsection 117(9)(d) is repeated for ease of reference:
"Excluded relationships
"(9) No foreign national may be considered a member of the family class by virtue of their relationship to a sponsor if
. . . . .
(d) the sponsor previously made an application for permanent residence and became a permanent resident and, at the time of that application, the foreign national was a non-accompanying family member or a former spouse or former common-law partner of the sponsor and was not examined."
"Restrictions
"(9) Ne sont pas considérées comme appartenant à la catégorie du regroupement familial du fait de leur relation avec le répondant les personnes suivantes:
. . . . .
d) dans le cas où le répondant est devenu résident permanent à la suite d'une demande à cet effet, l'étranger qui, à l'époque où cette demande a été faite, n'a pas fait l'objet d'un contrôle et était un membre de la famille du répondant n'accompagnant pas ce dernier ou était un ex-époux ou ancien conjoint de fait du répondant."
[21]
Subsection 25(1) of
IRPA
provides that an exemption may be granted from any applicable criteria if the Minister is of the opinion that the exemption is justified by humanitarian and compassionate considerations, taking into account the best interests of the children. Accordingly, the applicant's two sons can request an exemption from subsection 117(9)(d), which request could be supported by the applicant. Under section 25, Parliament provides an equitable jurisdiction whereby humanitarian and compassionate considerations and the best interests of the child are to be weighed.
[22]
Section 25(1) of
IRPA
reads as follows:
"Humanitarian and compassionate considerations
"25(1) The Minister shall, upon request of a foreign national who is inadmissible or who does not meet the requirements of this Act, and may, on the Minister's own initiative, examine the circumstances concerning the foreign national and may grant the foreign national permanent resident status or an exemption from any applicable criteria or obligation of this Act if the Minister is of the opinion that it is justified by humanitarian and compassionate considerations relating to them, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected, or by public policy considerations."
"Séjour pour motif d'ordre humanitaire
"25(1) Le ministre doit, sur demande d'un étranger interdit de territoire ou qui ne se conforme pas à la présente loi, et peut, de sa propre initiative, étudier le cas de cet étranger et peut lui octroyer le statut de résident permanent ou lever tout ou partie des critères et obligations applicables, s'il estime que des circonstances d'ordre humanitaire relatives à l'étranger - compte tenu de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant directement touché - ou l'intérêt public le justifient."
Position of the Parties
A) The Applicant
[23]
The applicant submits that subsection 117(9)(d) of the
Regulations
("the impugned subsection") is ultra vires
IRPA
because it is inconsistent with the objectives and purposes of the
Act
, which is to promote family reunification in Canada. In particular, the applicant submits that subsection 117(9)(d) of the
Regulations
is ultra vires subsections 3(3)(f), 12(1), and 14(1) of
IRPA
.
[24]
The applicant submits that the impugned subsection does not take the best interests of the child into account, since it prevents the reunification of certain dependent children with their parents in Canada, contrary to the various international human rights instruments to which Canada is signatory.
[25]
The applicant submits that the impugned subsection creates an unlawful definition of "family class" since that term has already been expressly defined in subsection 12(1) of
IRPA
. The applicant also submits that subsection 14(1) of
IRPA
implicitly prohibits a further definition of family class.
[26]
The applicant submits that the impugned subsection has interfered with her right of liberty and security of the person, and that it has denied her the right to a fair hearing, in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.
B) The Respondent
[27]
The respondent submits that subsection 117(9)(d) of the
Regulations
is valid legislation, and is consistent with the objectives and purposes of
IRPA
. The respondent argues that subsection 117(9)(d) does not prevent the applicant from reuniting with her sons since it does not interfere with the following remaining options open to the applicant and her sons:
(i) the applicant's sons may still apply to come to Canada as permanent residents, outside of the family class, and
(ii) the applicant's sons may request an exemption from subsection 117(9)(d) on humanitarian and compassionate grounds under section 25 of
IRPA
.
[28]
The respondent submits that subsection 117(9)(d) is not punitive in its purpose, and that the section serves to protect the integrity of the immigration system by removing any incentive for foreign nationals to exclude dependents from their applications for fear of inadmissibility, or other reasons, or to be untruthful in their applications for permanent residence.
[29]
The respondent submits that the separation of the applicant and her sons is the result of her own conscious and voluntary decision to leave them behind in the Philippines, and to be untruthful in her application for permanent residence. The respondent submits that the separation the applicant now complains of, is not the result of direct government action. The respondent argues that the
Regulations
simply effectuate the applicant's own choice not to include her sons as dependants.
[30]
The respondent submits that subsection 117(9)(d) in no way interferes with the applicant's substantive rights and is not contrary to any of Canada's international obligations. The respondent submits that while the best interests of the child is an important consideration, it is not determinative in the matter of whether or not a visa officer may issue a visa for permanent residence.
Analysis
Issue No. 1
Is subsection 117(9)(d) of the Regulations ultra vires IRPA?
[31]
While subsection 12(1) of
IRPA
directs how individuals may be selected for the "family class", it does not provide an express definition of the term. It refers to individuals who are related in a certain way. However, subsection 13(1) of
IRPA
clearly provides that the right to sponsor a family member is subject to the
Regulations
.
[32]
Furthermore, subsection 14(1) of
IRPA
specifically provides that the
Regulations
may define for the purposes of the
Act
, any terms used in Division 1 - which is "Requirements Before Entering Canada and Selection". And subsection 14(2) permits the
Regulations
to govern any matter relating to classes of permanent residents or foreign nationals, including conditions which may be imposed on applicants for family reunification. Those subsections provide, in part:
"Regulations
"14(1) The regulations may provide for any matter relating to the application of this Division, and may define, for the purposes of this Act, the terms used in this Division.
"14(2) The regulations may prescribe, and govern any matter relating to, classes of permanent residents or foreign nationals, including the classes referred to in section 12, and may include provisions respecting
. . . . .
(b) applications for visas and other documents and their issuance or refusal, with respect to foreign nationals and their family members;
. . . . .
(d) conditions that may or must be imposed, varied or cancelled, individually or by class, on permanent residents and foreign nationals;
(e) sponsorships, undertakings, and penalties for failure to comply with undertakings; [...]"
"Application générale
"14(1) Les règlements régissent l'application de la présente section et définissent, pour l'application de la présente loi, les termes qui y sont employés.
"Sélection et formalités
"14(2) Ils établissent et régissent les catégories de résidents permanents ou d'étrangers, dont celles visées à l'article 12, et portent notamment sur:
. . . . .
b) la demande, la délivrance et le refus de délivrance de visas et autres documents pour les étrangers et les membres de leur famille;
. . . . .
d) les conditions qui peuvent ou doivent être, quant aux résidents permanents et aux étrangers, imposées, modifiées ou levées, individuellement ou par catégorie;
e) le parrainage, les engagements, ainsi que la sanction de leur inobservation; [...]"
Accordingly, it is my view that Parliament has clearly delegated the subject of sponsoring members of the family class to the
Regulations
.
[33]
Now I must determine if section 117(9)(d) of the
Regulations
is contrary to
IRPA
, and therefore ultra vires.
[34]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) per Strayer, J.A., the Federal Court of Appeal sets out the basis upon which a Court is to determine whether a particular Regulation is ultra vires a statute. Strayer, J.A., held at paragraph 14:
"¶ 14 It goes without saying that it is not for a court to determine the wisdom of delegated legislation or to assess its validity on the basis of the court's policy preferences. The essential question for the court always is:
does the statutory grant of authority permit this particular delegated legislation?
In looking at the statutory source of authority one must seek all possible indicia as to the purpose and scope of permitted delegated legislation. Any limitations, express or implied, on the exercise of that power must be taken into account. One must then look to the regulation itself to see whether it conforms and where it is argued that the regulation was not made for the purposes authorized by the statute one must try to identify one or more of those purposes for which the regulation was adopted.
It is accepted that a broad discretionary power, including a regulation-making power may not be used for a completely irrelevant purpose but it is up to the party attacking the regulation to demonstrate what that illicit purpose might be
." (Emphasis added)
[35]
I am satisfied that the purpose of subsection 117(9)(d) of the
Regulations
is for the proper administration of Canada's immigration law. It is reasonable that the immigration law would require an applicant for permanent residence disclose, on his or her application, all members of his or her family. Otherwise, the application for permanent residence could not be assessed properly for the purposes of the immigration law. Accordingly, subsection 117(9)(d) of the
Regulations
is for a relevant purpose, i.e. to prevent the fraudulent concealment of material circumstances which might prevent the applicant from being admitted to Canada.
[36]
The applicant also submits that the impugned subsection is ultra vires
IRPA
because it impedes "family reunification", an objective of
IRPA
.
[37]
Paragraph 3(1)(d) of
IRPA
provides:
"Objectives - immigration
"3(1) The objectives of this Act with respect to immigration are
. . . . .
(d) to see that families are reunited in Canada;"
"Objet en matière d'immigration
"3(1) En matière d'immigration, la présente loi a pour objet:
. . . . .
d) de veiller à la réunification des familles au Canada;"
[38]
The objective of family reunification does not override, outweigh, supercede or trump the basic requirement that the immigration law must be respected, and administered in an orderly and fair manner. An applicant cannot be allowed to misrepresent her family members and marital status to circumvent the immigration law, and then challenge the validity of the family class law as ultra vires because it impedes the reunification of her family. Such a result would be contrary to the proper, fair and orderly administration of the immigration law.
Issue No. 2
Is subsection 117(9)(d) of the IPR Regulations ultra vires subsection 3(3)(f) of IRPA as it does not comply with Canada's international human rights obligations?
[39]
The applicant submits that the provisions of
IRPA
and its
Regulations
must conform with Canada's domestic and international human rights obligations. This is mandated by
IRPA's
interpretation provision, subsection 3(3):
"3(3) This Act is to be construed and applied in a manner that
. . . . .
(f) complies with international human rights instruments to which Canada is signatory."
"3(3) L'interprétation et la mise en oeuvre de la présente loi doivent avoir pour effet:
. . . . .
f) de se conformer aux instruments internationaux portant sur les droits de l'homme dont le Canada est signataire."
[40]
The applicant submits that by denying parents who have committed misrepresentation the ability to sponsor their children, subsection 117(9)(d) is inconsistent with the following principles found in human rights instruments to which Canada is signatory:
(a) a parent's rights not to be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy, family or home and to the protection of the family;
(b) a child's rights to have their best interests considered in actions that concern them, to be cared for by their parents, and to be reunited with their family in a positive, expeditious and humane manner.
[41]
The applicant relies upon the following nine international instruments:
(1) Charter of the United Nations (1945)
(2) Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948)
(3) International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR)
(4) Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties
(5) International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)
(6) Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT)
(7) Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)
(8) European Court of Human Rights (ECHR)
(9) The African Charter on Human and People's Rights
[42]
I will set out in some detail the rights and Conventions relied upon by the applicant.
(i)
Right not to be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy, family or home
[43]
Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights reads as follows:
"1. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.
"2. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks."
[44]
This right is also provided to children in Article 16 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child:
"1. No child shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his or her honour and reputation.
"2. The child has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks."
[45]
It is submitted that denial of the ability to sponsor constitutes an arbitrary violation of the right to be free from interference with privacy, home and family.
(ii)
Right to protection of the family
[46]
International human right documents declare the importance of state protection of the family unit in various ways. For example, Article 10 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights reads:
"The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize that:
1. The widest possible protection and assistance should be accorded to the family, which is the natural and fundamental group unit of society, particularly for its establishment and while it is responsible for the care and education of dependent children. ...
. . . . .
3. Special measures of protection and assistance should be taken on behalf of all children and young persons without any discrimination for reasons of parentage or other conditions."
(iii)
Rights of the children involved\Best interests of the child (Convention on the Rights of the Child, Article 3)
[47]
Article 3(1) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child states:
"1. In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, court of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration."
[48]
The Supreme Court held in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 193 that immigration decisions must consider the best interest of the children involved due to the influence of the CRC. The applicant submits that "all actions concerning children" includes a regulation that prevents children from being sponsored.
[49]
The applicant submits that paragraph 117(9)(d) of the
IRP Regulations
does not allow for any consideration of the best interests of the child. There is no appeal allowed, and no access to any kind of review where the best interests of the children would be considered. The integrity of the system which the respondent claims to protect by this provision is not concerned with the child's best interest.
(iv)
Right to be cared for by parents and not to be separated from parents (CRC Article 7(1) and 9(1), Article 17 of the ICCPR)
[50]
Article 9(1) of the CRC states:
"States Parties shall ensure that a child shall not be separated from his or her parents against their will, except when competent authorities subject to judicial review determine, in accordance with applicable law and procedures, that such separation is necessary for the best interests of the chid. Such determination may be necessary in a particular case such as one involving abuse or neglect of the child by the parents, or one where the parents are living separately and a decision must be made as to the child's place of residence."
[51]
The applicant submits that according to this section, separation from parents is only justified in the child's best interests, such as in a child neglect case. As discussed above, this is not the case here. By separating children from parents without providing any chance of reunion, subsection 117(9) interferes with the right to be cared for by parents and not to be separated from parents.
(v)
Right to be reunited with parents in a positive, humane and expeditious manner (CRC Article 10(1))
[52]
Article 10 of the CRC provides that "applications by a child or his or her parents to enter or leave a State Party for the purpose of family reunification shall be dealt with by States Parties in a positive, humane and expeditious manner". The applicant submits that this appears to be the only international human rights instrument provision that expressly refers to family reunification. By contrast with the wording of Article 10, paragraph 117(9)(d) operates in a negative and inhumane manner.
Analysis with respect to Issue No. 2
[53]
I have concluded that subsection 3(3)(f) of
IRPA
codifies the common law canon of statutory construction that domestic law should be interpreted to reflect the values contained in international human rights conventions to which Canada has ascribed. In
Baker
, supra the Supreme Court held at paragraph 70 that the human rights values in these international conventions "help inform the contextual approach" which the Court should incorporate when interpreting statutes. However, subsection 3(3)(f) of
IRPA
does not incorporate international human rights conventions as part of Canadian law, or state that they override plain words in a statute. Subsection (3)(3)(f) of
IRPA
means that the conventions be considered by the Court as "context" when interpreting ambiguous provisions of the immigration law. I am of the opinion that subsection 117(9)(d) of the
Regulations
is plain, clear, and unambiguous. It leaves no room for such interpretation.
[54]
In any event,
IRPA
provides a mechanism in subsection 25(1) to exempt the applicant's two sons from subsection 117(9)(d) of the
Regulations
for humanitarian and compassionate reasons or for the best interests of the children.
[55]
I am of the view that section 25 of
IRPA
reflects and fulfills Canada's commitment to take human rights and the best interests of children into account when administering the immigration law. Subsection 117(9)(d) of the
Regulations
is not an inflexible rule precluding sponsorship in appropriates cases. The applicant can support her sons in invoking section 25. That section can recognize that the applicant is the mother, who would have been able to sponsor her two sons if she had properly disclosed them when she applied for permanent residence to Canada. That section can apply equitable factors in appropriate cases.
Issue No. 3
Is subsection 117(9)(d) of the
Regulations
contrary to section 7 of the
Charter
?
[56]
Section 7 of the
Charter
provides:
"Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice."
"Chacun a droit à la vie, à la liberté et à la sécurité de sa personne; il ne peut être porté atteinte à ce droit qu'en conformité avec les principes de justice fondamental."
[57]
The applicant submits that subsection 117(9)(d) of the
Regulations
violates section 7 of the
Charter
. The legislated restriction on her right to sponsor her child interferes with her ability to make fundamental, personal decisions and imposes serious psychological stress. This deprivation is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice as it is arbitrary and punitive and violates the right to be heard.
[58]
I will detail the arguments made by the applicant in this regard:
(i)
Security of the person -- serious state-imposed psychological stress
[59]
The applicant submits that paragraph 117(9)(d) of the
Regulations
adversely affects the sponsor's security of the person. The applicant is subject to the distress of the loss of companionship of the child. She is stigmatized as someone who is not allowed to have her children with her because of her past behaviour -- behaviour which is unrelated to her ability to raise her children. Her social and family life are disrupted to the point that she must choose between the country where she has established herself and her children. This stress and anxiety rises well beyond the stresses of ordinary life.
(ii)
Not in accordance with principles of fundamental justice
[60]
The deprivation of the applicant's liberty and/or security interests does not comply with the principle of fundamental justice as it is punitive and arbitrary. Further, the applicant's ability to sponsor is removed without giving her an opportunity to be heard or to have her situation individually considered on its merits.
(iii)
There is no right to be heard
[61]
Subsection 117(9)(d) excludes the applicant's children from the family class. This deprives the applicant of an appeal to the IAD, as the Board's jurisdiction is limited to those cases involving members of the family class. As a result, the sponsor is denied an opportunity to be heard. There is no way to balance the state's interests with those of the individuals concerned, and therefore there is no process in which the applicant can present evidence.
(iv)
Section 1 justification
[62]
The applicant further submits that the restriction cannot be justified under section 1 of the
Charter
. While it is an important goal to minimize immigration based on misrepresentation, subsection 117(9)(d) is disproportionate to this goal. It is an absolute, arbitrary regulation that is not rationally connected to this goal and is not the least impairing alternative. Section 40* of
IRPA
and sections 10 and 18* of the
Citizenship Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-29 provide sufficient deterrence against persons making misrepresentations to gain entry into Canada. *See appendix A attached for these provisions.
Analysis with respect to Issue No. 3
[63]
I am of the view that to trigger section 7 of the
Charter
, the Court must first find that there has been a deprivation of the right to life and security of the person, and second, that the deprivation is contrary to the principles of fundamental justice.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  B.C.A.C. 161; 231 W.A.C. 161; 190 D.L.R.(4th) 513; 23 Admin. L.R.(3d) 175 at paragraph 47  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . It is established that the liberty interest protected by section 7 of the
Charter
is not restricted to mere freedom from physical restraint. Liberty can be engaged where the state compels or prohibits important and fundamental life choices.
[64]
When the applicant made a fundamental life choice to separate herself from her two sons and emigrate, she did so subject to the immigration law of Canada. She cannot now argue that her liberty is affected by that law, which restricts the "family class" to members of the applicant's family who were disclosed and examined at the time the applicant applied for permanent residence. Realistically the applicant would probably not have been admitted to Canada if she had disclosed her family members because it would have become apparent that she was married or in a common law relationship.
[65]
With respect to the security of the applicant, the constitutional guarantee of security of the person does not protect against the "ordinary stresses and anxieties that a person of reasonable sensibility would suffer as a result of government action".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> per Heneghan, J. In fact, there is no evidence before the Court that the applicant suffered stress or anxiety. Counsel for the applicant asks that the Court take judicial notice that the inability of the applicant to sponsor her two sons would cause stress. I am of the view that that stress is no more than the stress which the applicant voluntarily chose to accept when she decided to separate from her two sons in 1993. That stress is self-imposed.
[66]
Moreover, I find that the applicant's right to security of person was not infringed as a consequence of any action by the government. As a potential immigrant, she was subject to the requirements of the immigration law and regulations. She had no other right to enter Canada. She chose to ignore that law by misrepresenting her true family situation when she sought admission to Canada as a permanent resident. She cannot submit that that law deprived her of the right to security of person. Such an argument is in the realm of the absurd.
[67]
The applicant submits that her liberty and security interests have been deprived without complying with the principles of fundamental justice. On May 13, 2004 the IAD decided a similar case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  purpose, importance and rationale for requiring applicants disclose all members of their "family class". The principle of family reunification requires that immigration authorities assess the family as a whole and the eligibility of each member who is seeking admission to Canada or may, in the future, seek admission in the preferred family class category. The IAD stated at paragraph 30:
"[...] The required accurate disclosure goes to the heart of the integrity of the system."
and at paragraph 31:
"[...] In balancing the individual against societal interest in this case, I conclude the societal interest in preserving the integrity of the immigration system by way of limiting the present applicant's eligibility to Canada within the family class category would justify a deprivation of the appellant's alleged
Charter
right [...]"
and at paragraph 33:
"In my view, it would, in fact, offend fundamental justice were the appellant, in the particular circumstances of this case, to be permitted to sponsor her previously undisclosed dependant at this time. I note her admission at hearing that the sponsorship of the applicant was filed only after she received her own Canadian citizenship and felt herself to be 'shielded' from adverse immigration proceedings respecting the non-disclosure."
I agree with IAD Member Warkun that it would offend fundamental justice were the applicant permitted to sponsor her previously undisclosed relatives at this time. I think this restriction is a reasonable limit on her section 7
Charter
rights.
[68]
Counsel for the applicant argues that if the respondent had any concern about the false representations made by the applicant upon which she obtained permanent residence in Canada, that the respondent would take action under section 10 of the
Citizenship Act
. Section 10 of the
Citizenship Act
provides that a person who was lawfully admitted to Canada for permanent residence by false representation or fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances may be subject to government action to have his or her citizenship revoked. I would think the applicant imprudent to taunt the respondent in this regard. The inaction by the respondent may not indicate acquiescence, only inadequate resources and other priorities.
[69]
In any event, the applicant's two sons have the right to apply for permanent residence in Canada and to seek an exemption under section 25 of
IRPA
from subsection 117(9)(d) of the
Regulations
, for humanitarian and compassionate grounds or on the basis that it is in the best interests of the child. The applicant can support such an application and ask that the respondent consider her separation from her sons. Accordingly, section 25 provides the applicant's two sons and the applicant with an opportunity to obtain an exemption from the legislated restriction on her right to sponsor her children. Such an exemption completely undermines her claim that subsection 117(9)(d) of the
Regulations
is so inflexible that it violates her section 7
Charter
rights, including her right to be heard on the subject.
[70]
In view of my findings that section 7 of the
Charter
has not been infringed, I do not need to consider whether such infringement is justified as a reasonable limitation in a free and democratic society under section 1 of the
Charter
. However, I will state my view in the alternative. Liberty, in a free and democratic society, must be subject to reasonable limits. A person's right to liberty is subject to the law of the land. In my view, the restriction in subsection 117(9)(d) of the
Regulations
in conjunction with section 25 of
IRPA
is a reasonable limit. This is also a reasonable limit on her section 7
Charter
rights.
Conclusion
[71]
For these reasons, I have concluded that:
1. paragraph 117(9)(d) of the
Regulations
is not ultra vires
IRPA
;
2. paragraph 117(9)(d) of the
Regulations
is plain and clear statutory language, and that it is not open to being construed under subsection 3(3)(f) of
IRPA
in the context of Canada's international obligations under human rights conventions; and,
3. paragraph 117(9)(d) of the
Regulations
is constitutional and consistent with section 7 of the
Canadian Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms
.
Proposed Certified Question
[72]
The applicant proposed that the three issues of this case be certified as serious questions of general importance. I am of the view that the first question, whether subsection 117(9)(d) of the
Regulations
is ultra vires subsection 12(1) of
IRPA
, is not a serious question of general importance. This Regulation is clearly related to the purpose of the Act and there is no doubt that the statutory grant of authority in section 14 of
IRPA
permits this Regulation for the reasons herein.
[73]
With respect to the second question, whether subsection 117(9)(d) of the
Regulations
is ultra vires paragraph 3(3)(f) of
IRPA
as it does not comply with Canada's international human rights obligations, subsection 25(1) of
IRPA
directly complies with Canada's obligations in this regard. Subsection 25(1) of
IRPA
allows the applicant's two sons, with the support of the applicant, to seek exemption from subsection 117(9)(d) of the
Regulations
on humanitarian and compassionate grounds, taking into account the best interests of the child. Accordingly, I am of the view that the second question does not raise a question of serious importance which ought to be certified.
[74]
With respect to the third question, namely whether subsection 117(9)(d) of the
Regulations
is contrary to section 7 of the
Charter
, I agree that this is a question of serious importance. Accordingly, the following question will be certified:
Is subsection 117(9)(d) of the
Immigration Refugee Protection Regulations
invalid or inoperative because it is unconstitutional as it deprives the applicant of her right to liberty and/or her right to security of person, in a manner not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice, contrary to section 7 of the
Charter
?
Application dismissed.
