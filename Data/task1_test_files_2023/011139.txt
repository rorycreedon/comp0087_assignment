Dub√©, J.
: This application pursuant to Rule 465(18) is for an Order that Edward Zyblut and Gordon McFarlane answer a certain number of questions asked at the examination for discovery dated December 19, 1985.
[2]
At the outset, the Crown raised, then withdrew, an objection to the filing of the transcripts of the examinations without the benefit of an affidavit on the part of the plaintiffs. The technical point was well taken. All documents filed in support of a motion should be by way of an affidavit. It is therefore now ordered that the two transcripts be and are duly filed.
[3]
The plaintiffs' action is for a declaration that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans' Program of season deferral and trap limitation for the years 1986 and 1987 is invalid and an injunction restraining the defendant from announcing or proceeding with such a program.
[4]
Edward Ronald Zyblut
is the manager of the Offshore Division of the department. He was advised by counsel not to answer or produce documents on questions numbered 24, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 55, 70, 71, 75, 76, 77, 78, 83, 85, 95, 103, 105, 111, 112, 117, 126, 130, 131, 134, 148, 154, 155, 172, 173, 176, 177, 178, 180 and 181.
[5]
The following questions seek the production of documents which, in my view, are relevant and ought to be produced. Counsel for the defendant alleges that the documents may not be available, or may be privileged. The onus is on him either to produce them or to file an affidavit showing why they are either unavailable or privileged. The numbered questions are as follows: 24, 27, 112 and 117.
[6]
The following questions obviously seek opinions and need not be answered: questions numbered: 30, 70, 71, 75, 76, 77, 78, 83, 103, 126, 130, 131, 134, 148, 154, 155, 172, 173, 176, 177 and 178.
[7]
The following numbered questions are relevant and ought to be answered: 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 55, 85, 95 and 181.
[8]
The following questions are not relevant and need not be answered: 105, 111 and 180.
[9]
Gordon Alexander McFarlane
is a biologist with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. No satisfactory explanations were given as to why he was produced as a second witness by the Crown. The normal practice is to produce only one witness who must inform himself and provide answers or documents to all relevant questions. The fact that this witness is an expert in his field naturally led the other party to seek opinions from him. The purpose of discovery, however, is not to solicit opinions but to obtain facts from the other party.
[10]
Jurisprudence has provided only one exception: it is permissible to seek opinions at discovery where the expertise of the witness is put in issue by the pleadings. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). It cannot be said here that the expertise of this witness was put in issue by the pleadings. The statement of claim attacks the wisdom of the proposed program but does not directly challenge the expertise of Gordon Alexander McFarlane, although the latter, admittedly, took part in the formulation of the program. Consequently, all questions seeking opinions from him need not be answered. They are questions numbered 33, 34, 35, 46, 51, 55, 59, 60, 70, 71, 102, 103, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 130 and 131.
[11]
The following questions are relevant and ought to be answered. It is not sufficient for the witness to say that he does not know the answer. Having been offered as a witness, his duty is to inform himself and to answer all relevant questions put to him. Questions numbered 22, 24, 32, 38, 44, 52, 53, 68, 69, 72, 73, 76, 77, 86, 87, 90, 109 and must be answered.
[12]
Questions numbered 19, 20, 21, 30, 122 are not relevant or abandoned and need not be answered.
[13]
1. The following questions put to Edward Ronald Zyblut shall be answered and documents produced within twenty days. Questions numbered 24, 27, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 55, 85, 95, 112, 117 and 181.
2. The following questions put to Gordon Alexander McFarlane shall be answered and documents produced within twenty days. Questions numbered 22, 24, 32, 38, 44, 52, 53, 68, 69, 72, 73, 76, 77, 86, 87, 90 and 109.
3. The two transcripts of the examinations for discovery shall be filed on the record.
4. Costs in the cause.
Order accordingly.
