Denault, J.
[Translation]: This is an application for judicial review seeking an order against the Minister of National Revenue for the purpose of revoking a peremptory request for payment under s. 224(1) of the
Income Tax Act
, R.S.C. 1985 (5th Supp.), c. 1 (the "
Act
") requiring "The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company" (hereinafter "Financière Manuvie") to pay the Receiver General 30% of the wages or salary owing to the applicant.
[2]
On June 26, 1997, the Department of National Revenue (the "Department") issued a notice of assessment against the applicant in the amount of $1,992.53 for the 1996 taxation year. On January 14, 1998, Ms. Joanne Potvin, an employee of the Department, mailed a collection letter to the applicant asking that she contact her and notifying her that if she failed to respond to this letter she would be subject without further notice to legal proceedings in regard to the amount she owed for the 1996 taxation year.
[3]
On March 5, 1998, the Department issued a peremptory request for payment against Financière Manuvie in the amount of $1,956.11. This request covered a monthly annuity (#453-0340, certificates #0003 and 0004) payable to the applicant under a supplemental pension plan of the unionized employees of Vidéotron Ltée, Quebec division [see footnote 1].
[4]
On November 16, 1998, the applicant filed this application for judicial review in the Registry of this court. The only question the parties are asking this court to answer is the following:
"May the federal Crown, notwithstanding articles 2377, 2378 and 2645 of the
Civil Code of Quebec
and paragraph 553(7) of the Quebec
Code of Civil Procedure
, seize the applicant's annuity vested in a supplementary pension plan through the peremptory request for payment procedure prescribed in s. 224(1) of the
Income Tax Act
?"
[5]
The applicant argues in substance that these provisions of the
Civil Code
and the
Code of Civil Procedure
, which state that an annuity under such a plan is unseizable, warrant the revocation of the request for payment dated March 5, 1998.
[6]
Section 224(1) of the
Act
allows the Department to garnish third parties for amounts they are required to pay to a tax debtor.
"
SECTION 224: Garnishment
(1) Where the Minister has knowledge or suspects that a person is, or will be within one year, liable to make a payment to another person who is liable to make a payment under this Act (in this subsection and subs. (1.1) and (3) referred to as the 'tax debtor'), the Minister may in writing require the person to pay forthwith, where the moneys are immediately payable, and in any other case as and when the moneys become payable, the moneys otherwise payable to the tax debtor in whole or in part to the Receiver General on account of the tax debtor's liability under this Act."
[7]
The question raised by the applicant is both limited and complex. It is limited in that the applicant is not disputing (a) that the Parliament of Canada has the power to make laws concerning, inter alia, "the raising of Money by any Mode or System of Taxation" (s. 91(3) of the
Constitution Act
, 1867 (U.K.), 30 & 31 Vict., c. 3); (b) that this power includes the power to collect these taxes; and (c) that the Minister of National Revenue had the power to make the peremptory request for payment under s. 224 of the
Act
.
[8]
However, it is complex in that the applicant is pleading that by seizing her annuity, the Department is trenching upon an activity affecting property and civil rights, an activity within the jurisdiction of the provinces under s. 92(13) of the
Constitu- tion Act, 1867
[see footnote 2]. The federal Crown, she argues, is bound by the provisions of the
Civil Code of Quebec
and the
Code of Civil Procedure
, which state that an annuity under a supplemental pension plan is exempt from seizure.
[9]
This case raises an essentially theoretical issue [see footnote 3] in that the applicant's counsel frankly and candidly acknowledged that this application for judicial review, while having some potential practical application, was intended to get some clarification by the court of an extremely difficult and complex question, asked by some authorities [see footnote 4], as to the extent of the federal Crown's privilege not to be bound by provincial legislation decreeing certain property exempt from seizure.
[10]
In short, the applicant's thesis is that in so far as the
Civil Code of Quebec
and the
Code of Civil Procedure
constitute the Quebec equivalent of the common law, and the provincial legislature specifically rendered her annuity unseizable when it enacted articles 2377, 2378 and 2645
C.C.
and paragraph 553(7)
C.C.P.
[see footnote 5], the Department of National Revenue acted illegally in seizing it. The applicant bases her argument in part on the preamble to Bill C-50, to harmonize federal law with the civil law of the Province of Quebec and to amend certain Acts in order to ensure that each language version takes into account the common law and the civil law [see footnote 6], and on the repeal, since the enactment of the
Civil Code of Quebec
, of the old article 9 of the
Civil Code of Lower Canada
, under which no Act affects the rights of the Crown unless the Crown is mentioned.
[11]
I will quickly dispose of the submission based on Bill C-50, since it was not enacted by Parliament and died on the order paper. I am also of the opinion that the facts of this case in no way involve the application of art. 2377 and 2378 of the
Civil Code of Quebec
. Paragraph 553(7)
C.P.P.
cannot serve as a foundation for the applicant's argument, in this case, in so far as the record, in the first place, does not disclose that the employer contributed to this supplemental pension plan on the applicant's behalf [see footnote 7]. Furthermore, the record does not disclose whether the
Supplemental Pension Plans Act
, R.S.Q., c. 15.1, and more specifically s. 264(2) thereof, which declares that a benefit is exempt from seizure, applies in this case, and the applicant's counsel, no doubt deliberately, did not maintain any such argument.
[12]
Judicial attacks on s. 224 of the
Act
are not novel. In
Pembina on the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), it was argued that in enacting s. 224 of the
Act
, Parliament had overridden the provinces' jurisdiction over property and civil rights. Although that litigation, it is true, involved s. 224(1.1) of the
Act
, Chief Justice Scott rejected that submission while making the following comments, which are applicable to the case at bar, at pp. 489-91:
"The purpose of the
Act
[the
Income Tax Act
] is not only to levy tax, but to collect it. There is a strong public duty on employers to remit; indeed, this is central to the scheme of self-assessment under the
Act
. The machinery for collection and enforcement under the
Act
is part of the very subject matter of s. 91(3) of the
Constitution Act
and not merely incidental to the raising of revenue [...] [pp. 137-138]
In my opinion, the dominant or most important characteristic of the legislation in general falls squarely within the ambit of the raising of revenue for the purposes of taxation under s. 91(3) of the
Constitution Act
. It is clearly necessarily incidental to the effective workings of the
Act
. [...] [p. 138]
[...] In my opinion, collection is an integral part of Parliament's taxation scheme and clearly authorized by s. 91(3) of the
Constitution Act
. That is the pith and substance of the section. Necessity or the wisdom of the technique is not the issue; rather, the question is whether the collection provisions fit within the scope of the federal legislation. This should be answered in the affirmative."
[13]
In
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 103 Sask.R. 124 (Q.B.), the plaintiff Sun Life challenged the peremptory request for payment addressed to it under s. 224(1) of the
Act
. Sun Life argued, first, that this provision was ultra vires as an intrusion on the province's jurisdiction, and, in the alternative, that the federal Crown was subject to s. 19 of the Saskatchewan
Pension Benefits Act
, which exempted from seizure an annuity of the type garnished by the Department in the instant case. After finding that s. 224(1) of the
Act
was not ultra vires, given Parliament's power under s. 91(3) of the
Constitution Act, 1867
, Armstrong, J., ruled as follows on the issue of whether the provincial legislation at issue was binding on the federal Crown (p. 511):
"The purpose of s. 19 of the
Pension Benefits Act
is not wholly frustrated by the same not being binding on the Crown in right of Canada any more than the purpose is wholly frustrated by the exceptions provided in ss. 19(2) and 19(3). It remains available to protect recipient of pensions like Young against ordinary creditors. It is hard to imagine that it was ever intended to be unilaterally made effective against the Crown in right of Canada.
Professor Peter W. Hogg,
Constitutional Law of Canada
, 2nd Ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 1985), suggests at p. 239:
'In general where the federal Crown is engaging in activity which is regulated by provincial law, it should be bound by the law.'
Whether this be so or not, the federal Crown in the present instance is not engaging in an activity regulated by provincial law. It is, rather, engaging in an activity which it is fully empowered to so engage by s. 91(3) of the
Constitution Act, 1867
, namely raising revenue.
" (Emphasis added)
[14]
The applicant does not dispute the
Sun Life
decision, but submits that in this case it should not be assigned the weight the respondent wishes to give it. She argues, in effect, that in so far as she relies on the provisions of the
Civil Code of Quebec
and the
Code of Civil Procedure
, the Quebec equivalent of the common law, and not on a statutory provision, the exemption from seizure rules should prevail and bar this garnishment.
[15]
That is not my opinion. For this argument to succeed, the applicant should first have explained the situation that existed under the common law of the other provinces in relation to the exemption from seizure of annuities before alleging Quebec's parity under the
Civil Code
or the
Code of Civil Procedure
. This she did not do. Furthermore, a cursory analysis of the fate reserved by Parliament for a tax debtor subject to seizure, depending on whether the seizure pertains to chattels or is performed by way of garnishment is sufficient to persuade oneself that the rules exempting an annuity from seizure are not enforceable against the respondent. Section 225 states, in effect, that the Department may seize a tax debtor's chattels unless they are exempt from seizure in the province in which the seizure is made [see footnote 8]. There is no similar restriction in the case of a garnishment under s. 224. This to me indicates Parliament's intention to deal differently with the seizure of the debtor's property depending on whether it is chattels or amounts owing to him by third persons. In regard to the latter, Parliament even reserves the right to seize these amounts in whole or in part [see footnote 9], thus excluding the rules of total or partial exemption from seizure enacted in the provinces as they affect the collection of taxes through s. 224.
[16]
But there is more. The courts have ruled many times on the self-sufficiency of tax laws, including the
Income Tax Act
, characterizing them as a "complete code" [see footnote 10]. In the interests of the uniform application of this federal statute and the equality of taxpayers before the taxation authorities, I am of the opinion that Parliament, under s. 224(1) of the
Income Tax Act
, has created a unique mechanism that gives its provision a genuine self-sufficiency in relation to private law [see footnote 11].
[17]
For these reasons, the application for judicial review is dismissed, with costs.
Application dismissed.

APPENDIX: Legislation
"
Civil Code of Quebec:
:
Art. 2377. A stipulation to the effect that the annuity is unseizable and inalienable is without effect unless the annuity is received gratuitously by the annuitant and, even in such a case, the stipulation has effects only up to the amount of the annuity necessary for the annuitant as support.
Art. 2378. Any capital accumulated for the payment of the annuity is unseizable where the annuity is payable to the annuitant and to the person substituted for him, so long as the capital is applied to the payment of an annuity.
Only that part of the capital is unseizable, however, which, in the estimation of the seizing creditor, the debtor an the annuitant or, if they disagree, the court, would be necessary, for the duration fixed in the contract, for the payments of an annuity which would meet the requirements of the annuitant for support.
Art. 2645. Any person under a personal obligation charges, for its performance, all his property, movable and immovable, present and future, except property which is exempt from seizure or property which is the object of a division of patrimony permitted by law.
However, the debtor may agree with his creditor to be bound to fulfil his obligation only from the property they designate."
"
Code of Civil Procedure:
553. The following are exempt from seizure:
. . . . .
7. Benefits payable under a supplemental pension plan to which an employer contributes on behalf of his employees, other amounts declared unseizable by an Act governing such plans and contributions paid or to be paid into such plans.

In so doing, it explicitly confers a genuine autonomy on its statute with respect to the private law of the provinces, because federal law prevails over any provincial law that is incompatible with it."
