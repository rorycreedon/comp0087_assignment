Introduction
[1]
Heneghan, J.
: The Chief Pensions Advocate (the "Applicant") seeks judicial review, pursuant to the
Federal Courts Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, as amended, of Interpretation decision No. I-1 made by the Veterans Review Appeal Board (the "VRAB" or the "Board") on February 1, 2005. In that decision, the VRAB interpreted subsection 32(1) and section 111 of the
Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act
, S.C.1995, c. 18, as amended (the "
VRAB Act
" or "the
Act
") and concluded that new evidence submitted to the Board upon an application for reconsideration of an appeal decision would generally be subject to the requirements of "due diligence".
[2]
The Applicant seeks an Order to quash or set aside Interpretation decision No. I-1.
II.
Background
[3]
The Applicant is the head of the Bureau of Pension Advocates, a body that was continued pursuant to section 6.1 of the
Department of Veterans Affairs Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. V-1. The Bureau's role is to assist applicants for pensions and pensioners, upon request, in applications for review or appeals pursuant to the
Act
.
[4]
On December 9, 2003, he submitted a formal request to the VRAB for an Interpretation Hearing pursuant to subsection 37(1) of the
VRAB Act
. A hearing took place on November 23, 2004. The Bureau of Pensions Advocates, the Royal Canadian Legion, Dominion Command, the Canadian Peacekeeping Veterans Association and the Company of Master Marines of Canada appeared before the Board and made submissions. The following question was addressed:
"What criteria should be applied by the Veterans Review and Appeal Board (the Board) when determining whether to reconsider a decision based on the presentation of new evidence, under subsection 32(1) or section 111 of the
Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act
?"
[5]
In its decision, the Board said that it was dealing with the interpretation of section 31, in addition to the interpretation of sections 32 and 111. It reviewed the scheme of the
Act
, including the various levels of review relating to pension entitlement. It concluded that a person seeking reconsideration of a decision of the Board on the basis of new evidence must generally demonstrate that there had been no lack of due diligence in obtaining that evidence. It also addressed the factors of credibility, relevance and impact upon the final outcome.
[6]
The Board specifically adopted the reasoning of the Federal Court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In
Palmer
, the Court discussed the circumstances when new evidence would be admitted upon an appeal made pursuant to section 610(1)(d) of the
Criminal Code
, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34. The Court identified these circumstances having regard to, in the words of the enactment, "the interests of justice" and set forth the following principles at page 775:
"(1) The evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided that this general principle will not be applied as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases: see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  potentially decisive issue in the trial.
"(3) The evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief, and
"(4) It must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the result."
[7]
On the basis of the overall scheme of the
VRAB Act
and the Board's characterization of its appeal decisions as final and binding, the Board concluded that it should generally only exercise its discretionary power to reconsider a decision on the basis of new evidence when such evidence meets the standard of due diligence.
[8]
It also relied on administrative efficiency as a secondary consideration. In its synopsis of the Interpretation Decision, the Board summarized its conclusions as follows:
"The Board has concluded that the diligence principle of the test is applicable to reconsideration applications because it is consistent with the intent and spirit of the legislation and ultimately is in the best interests of appellants. The application of the principle of diligence recognizes that the proper time for gathering all relevant evidence and preparing an applicant's case in a complete and thorough manner is before a review hearing (termed a 'review' at the first stage of appeal before the Board) takes place. The application of the diligence principle allows for the reasonable assumption that any evidentiary gaps or shortcomings at that 'review' stage will have been addressed by the final hearing before the Board, which is termed the 'appeal' stage.
"The application of the diligence principle by the Board ultimately works to the advantage of the appellant and failures to obtain evidence necessary to establish a case are neither in the interests of the appellant nor of the administrative system as a whole. The Board recognizes that any pension or benefit to which the appellant is entitled should be awarded as early in the appeal process as possible, therefore it is incumbent upon the system to ensure the appellant's best possible case is put forward at the earliest possible time."
III.
Submissions
A.
The Applicant
[9]
The Applicant submits that the Board's decision is reviewable on the standard of correctness since it arises from the interpretation of the
VRAB Act
. He further argues that the decision is incorrect since the Board improperly supplemented the text of the statute by reading in the concept of due diligence, contrary to the plain language of subsection 32(1) and section 111 of the
VRAB Act
. The Applicant submits that the Board ignored the relevant principles of statutory interpretation, thereby committing an error of law.
[10]
Essentially, the Applicant argues that the clear and unambiguous language of the statutory provisions in issue should be interpreted according to that language and in a way that promotes the purposes of the
VRAB Act
. He submits that the statute contemplates the reconsideration of a claim on the basis of new evidence, without any limitations that would be imposed if the criterion of due diligence were imposed relative to such evidence.
B.
The Respondent
[11]
For his part, the Respondent argues that the appropriate standard of review according to a pragmatic and functional analysis is patent unreasonableness. He submits that, in some cases, deference is due to a tribunal's interpretation of questions of law and relies in this regard on the decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  B.C.A.C. 1; 75 W.A.C. 1.
[12]
The Respondent argues that the Board correctly interpreted subsection 32(1) and section 111 of the
VRAB Act
when it concluded that evidence submitted upon a request for reconsideration of a final decision would be assessed upon the standard of due diligence. He submits that the words "new evidence" are a term of art that has been judicially considered in a number of cases.
[13]
Further, the Respondent submits that the Board's Interpretation decision is consistent with the intention, expressed in section 31 of the
Act
, that decisions of the Board be final. The requirement of due diligence relative to new evidence, as a basis for reconsideration of an appeal decision, promotes that goal because it encourages an applicant to present the necessary evidence at the earliest possible time and reduces the likelihood of repeated requests for reconsideration.
[14]
In summary, the Respondent takes the position that the Board's Interpretation decision is correct and in any event withstands review upon the standard of patent unreasonableness.
IV.
Discussion and Disposition
[15]
The broad purpose of the
VRAB Act
is to provide a means for review of a decision upon an application for a pension. The Board may review an original decision made by the Minister or his delegate pursuant to the
Pension Act
, R.S. 1985, c. P-6 as amended. That right of review is conferred by section 84 of the
Pension Act
, supra, which provides as follows:
"84. An applicant who is dissatisfied with a decision made by the Minister under this Act, except under section 83, or under subsection 34(5) of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act, may apply to the Veterans Review and Appeal Board for a review of the decision."
"84. Le demandeur qui n'est pas satisfait d'une décision du ministre prise sous le régime de la présente loi, mais non sous celui de l'article 83, ou du paragraphe 34(5) de la Loi sur le Tribunal des anciens combattants (révision et appel) peut la faire réviser par le Tribunal."
[16]
The Board is created pursuant to section 4 of the
VRAB Act
. This section provides as follows:
"4. There is hereby established an independent board, to be known as the Veterans Review and Appeal Board, consisting of not more than twenty-nine permanent members to be appointed by the Governor in Council and such number of temporary members as are appointed in accordance with section 6."
"4. Est constitué un organisme indépendant, le Tribunal des anciens combattants (révision et appel), composé d'au plus vingt-neuf membres titulaires nommés par le gouverneur en conseil ainsi que des membres vacataires nommés en application de l'article 6."
[17]
The Board's mandate is to act as a review and appeal body respecting pension and benefit decisions for Veterans, Members of the Canadian Armed Forces and their dependants. Its mandate is set out in section 18 of the
Act
and reads as follows:
"18. The Board has full and exclusive jurisdiction to hear, determine and deal with all applications for review that may be made to the Board under the Pension Act or the Canadian Forces Members and Veterans Re-establishment and Compensation Act, and all matters related to those applications."
"18. Le Tribunal a compétence exclusive pour réviser toute décision rendue en vertu de la Loi sur les pensions ou prise en vertu de la Loi sur les mesures de réinsertion et d'indemnisation des militaires et vétérans des Forces canadiennes et pour statuer sur toute question liée à la demande de révision."
[18]
Section 21 of the
VRAB
provides that a review panel may uphold, vary or reverse a Ministerial decision that is being reviewed; refer any matter back to the Minister for reconsideration; or refer any matter that has not been dealt with back to the Minister for a decision. Section 23 of the
VRAB Act
allows a review panel, upon its own motion, to reconsider a decision made under section 21. Section 25 provides a right of appeal to the Board by an applicant who is dissatisfied with a decision made pursuant to section 21 or 23.
[19]
The Board's jurisdiction with respect to appeals is found in section 26 of the
Act
, as follows:
"26. The Board has full and exclusive jurisdiction to hear, determine and deal with all appeals that may be made to the Board under section 25 or under the War Veterans Allowance Act or any other Act of Parliament, and all matters related to those appeals."
"26. Le Tribunal a compétence exclusive pour statuer sur tout appel interjeté en vertu de l'article 25, ou sous le régime de la Loi sur les allocations aux anciens combattants ou de toute autre loi fédérale, ainsi que sur toute question connexe."
[20]
The decision at issue here was made by the Board pursuant to subsection 37(1) which provides as follows:
"37(1) The Minister, the Chief Pensions Advocate, any veterans' organization incorporated by or under an Act of Parliament or any interested person may refer to the Board for hearing and decision any question of interpretation relating to this Act, to the Pension Act, to any other Act of Parliament pursuant to which an appeal may be taken to the Board or to any regulations made under any such Act."
"37(1) Le ministre, l'avocat-conseil en chef du Bureau, toute organisation d'anciens combattants constituée en personne morale sous le régime d'une loi fédérale, ainsi que toute personne intéressée, peuvent saisir le Tribunal de toute question d'interprétation de la présente loi, de la Loi sur les pensions, de toute autre loi fédérale permettant d'en appeler au Tribunal, ou des règlements d'application de l'une ou l'autre de ces lois."
[21]
Since the Board is an administrative tribunal exercising statutory power, the Court must determine the applicable standard of review by conducting a pragmatic and functional analysis. That analysis requires consideration of four factors, that is the presence or absence of a privative clause; the expertise of the tribunal; the purpose of the legislation and of the particular provisions in issue; and the nature of the question.
[22]
The
Act
contains a provision that is in the nature of a privative clause. Specifically, section 31 of the
Act
provides as follows:
"31. A decision of the majority of members of an appeal panel is a decision of the Board and is final and binding."
"31. La décision de la majorité des membres du comité d'appel vaut décision du Tribunal; elle est définitive et exécutoire."
Decisions of the Board are amenable to judicial review pursuant to section 18.1 of the
Federal Courts Act
, supra. However, the language of section 31 suggests a high degree of deference.
[23]
The Board is a specialized tribunal and experienced in the discharge of its statutory mandate. This factor also favours a high degree of deference.
[24]
The purpose of the
VRAB Act
, broadly speaking, is to provide an avenue for review of decisions made concerning pensions for eligible persons. Sections 32 and 111 outline the circumstances where the Board has the discretion to reconsider its own prior decisions. The Board may act upon its own motion or upon the application of a person concerned. A concerned person may seek reconsideration upon the basis of an error of fact or law, or upon the basis of new evidence.
[25]
Subsection 32(1) and section 111 are in issue here and they provide as follows:
"32(1) Notwithstanding section 31, an appeal panel may, on its own motion, reconsider a decision made by it under subsection 29(1) or this section and may either confirm the decision or amend or rescind the decision if it determines that an error was made with respect to any finding of fact or the interpretation of any law, or may do so on application if the person making the application alleges that an error was made with respect to any finding of fact or the interpretation of any law or if new evidence is presented to the appeal panel.
"111. The Veterans Review and Appeal Board may, on its own motion, reconsider any decision of the Veterans Appeal Board, the Pension Review Board, the War Veterans Allowance Board, or an Assessment Board or an Entitlement Board as defined in section 79 of the Pension Act, and may either confirm the decision or amend or rescind the decision if it determines that an error was made with respect to any finding of fact or the interpretation of any law, or may, in the case of any decision of the Veterans Appeal Board, the Pension Review Board or the War Veterans Allowance Board, do so on application if new evidence is presented to it."
"32(1) Par dérogation à l'article 31, le comité d'appel peut, de son propre chef, réexaminer une décision rendue en vertu du paragraphe 29(1) ou du présent article et soit la confirmer, soit l'annuler ou la modifier s'il constate que les conclusions sur les faits ou l'interprétation du droit étaient erronées; il peut aussi le faire sur demande si l'auteur de la demande allègue que les conclusions sur les faits ou l'interprétation du droit étaient erronées ou si de nouveaux éléments de preuve lui sont présentés.
"111. Le Tribunal des anciens combattants (révision et appel) est habilité à réexaminer toute décision du Tribunal d'appel des anciens combattants, du Conseil de révision des pensions, de la Commission des allocations aux anciens combattants ou d'un comité d'évaluation ou d'examen, au sens de l'article 79 de la Loi sur les pensions, et soit à la confirmer, soit à l'annuler ou à la modifier comme s'il avait lui-même rendu la décision en cause s'il constate que les conclusions sur les faits ou l'interprétation du droit étaient erronées; s'agissant d'une décision du Tribunal d'appel, du Conseil ou de la Commission, il peut aussi le faire sur demande si de nouveaux éléments de preuve lui sont présentés."
[26]
The discretionary authority of the Board to entertain an application for reconsideration favours a high degree of deference.
[27]
Finally, there is the nature of the question. In the present case, it is a question of statutory interpretation. That is a legal question that generally attracts the standard of correctness. This approach was followed by the Court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.).
[28]
Three of the four factors engaged in a pragmatic and functional analysis favour a deferential view of the Board's decision. However, the nature of the question, that is involving statutory interpretation, tends toward the standard of correctness and, on balance, I conclude that correctness is the applicable standard of review.
[29]
According to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in
Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Bankrupt), Re
, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27; 221 N.R. 241; 106 O.A.C. 1, the guiding canon for questions of statutory interpretation is the purposive approach. At pages 40-41  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Iacobucci, speaking for the Court, said the following:
"Although much has been written about the interpretation of legislation (see, e.g., Ruth Sullivan,
Statutory Interpretation
(1997); Ruth Sullivan,
Driedger on the Construction of Statutes
(3rd Ed. 1994) (hereinafter '
Construction of Statutes
'); Pierre-André Côté,
The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada
(2nd Ed. 1991), Elmer
Driedger in Construction of Statutes
(2nd Ed. 1983) best encapsulates the approach upon which I prefer to rely. He recognizes that statutory interpretation cannot be founded on the wording of the legislation alone. At p. 87 he states:
'Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the
Act
, the object of the
Act
, and the intention of Parliament.'
. . . . .
"I also rely upon s. 10 of the
Interpretation Act
, R.S.O. 1980, c. 219, which provides that every Act 'shall be deemed to be remedial' and directs that every Act shall 'receive such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as will best ensure the attainment of the object of the Act according to its true intent, meaning and spirit.'"
[30]
Section 3 of the
VRAB Act
sets out the following general rule of construction for this statute:
"3. The provisions of this Act and of any other Act of Parliament or of any regulations made under this or any other Act of Parliament conferring or imposing jurisdiction, powers, duties or functions on the Board shall be liberally construed and interpreted to the end that the recognized obligation of the people and Government of Canada to those who have served their country so well and to their dependants may be fulfilled."
"3. Les dispositions de la présente loi et de toute autre loi fédérale, ainsi que de leurs règlements, qui établissent la compétence du Tribunal ou lui confèrent des pouvoirs et fonctions doivent s'interpréter de façon large, compte tenu des obligations que le peuple et le gouvernement du Canada reconnaissent avoir à l'égard de ceux qui ont si bien servi leur pays et des personnes à leur charge."
[31]
The purpose of the
Act
is to provide a forum for the review and appeal of decisions concerning the award of pension benefits. The
Act
is not designed to create hardships in the matter of awarding pension benefits. As well, the statute contemplates that qualified persons continue to have access to the hearing and review processes even after a determination has been made concerning the award of pension benefits. I refer to the decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), where the Court commented on the
Act's
predecessor legislation in general and its reconsideration provision in particular. The Court stated at page 10:
"... The effect of the scheme is that once a pension is awarded it is always reviewable, and in the course of such reviews the Board may have regard to any new evidence and amend its earlier findings of fact or of law in the event that it considers them to be erroneous. …" (References omitted)
[32]
The effect of the Board's Interpretation Decision is to impose a threshold issue when a request for reconsideration is made upon the basis of new evidence, that is whether an applicant can justify the prior unavailability of such evidence upon the basis of due diligence. The Board relies mainly upon the characterization of its decisions as final and binding, under section 31 of the
Act
, in reaching this conclusion.
[33]
In my opinion, the Board's focus on section 31 and administrative efficiency is misplaced. The purpose of the
Act
is to provide a forum for the review of decisions concerning pensions for qualified persons and their dependants. Notwithstanding section 31, the
Act
provides for reconsideration of such "final" decisions, in the exercise of the Board's discretion. Section 3 of the
Act
clearly states that the
Act
is to receive a liberal construction. Evidentiary doubt is to be resolved in favour of the person seeking a pension, if the evidence is credible and uncontradicted, pursuant to section 39.
[34]
Section 39 is a critical provision in this statute which, according to section 3, is to be given a liberal interpretation, for the benefit of qualified persons. Section 39 provides as follows:
"39. In all proceedings under this Act, the Board shall
(a) draw from all the circumstances of the case and all the evidence presented to it every reasonable inference in favour of the applicant or appellant;
(b) accept any uncontradicted evidence presented to it by the applicant or appellant that it considers to be credible in the circumstances; and
(c) resolve in favour of the applicant or appellant any doubt, in the weighing of evidence, as to whether the applicant or appellant has established a case."
"39. Le Tribunal applique, à l'égard du demandeur ou de l'appelant, les règles suivantes en matière de preuve:
a) il tire des circonstances et des éléments de preuve qui lui sont présentés les conclusions les plus favorables possible à celui-ci;
b) il accepte tout élément de preuve non contredit que lui présente celui-ci et qui lui semble vraisemblable en l'occurrence;
c) il tranche en sa faveur toute incertitude quant au bien-fondé de la demande."
[35]
In my opinion, the statutory framework suggests that due diligence is not to be considered the predominant factor. Section 3 should guide the interpretation of the
Act
. It is a rule of construction that is specifically said to be liberal and to favour an applicant. The undoubted discretion of the Board to entertain an application for reconsideration on the basis of new evidence must be exercised in a way that respects other provisions of the
Act
, in particular sections 3 and 39.
[36]
While section 31 says that appeal decisions are final and binding, other sections of the
Act
clearly and unambiguously state that the Board has the discretion to reconsider a prior decision. Legislation must be interpreted in a coherent manner. In this regard, I refer to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , where the Court said, at page 38  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , that "there is a presumption that the legislature did not intend to make or empower the making of contradictory statements".
[37]
As well, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  N.S.R.(2d) 1; 247 A.P.R. 1 at page 825  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice McLachlin (as she then was) said the following:
"I start from the fundamental principle of construction that provisions of a statute dealing with the same subject should be read together, where possible, so as to avoid conflict: Driedger,
Construction of Statutes
(2nd Ed. 1983), p. 66. In this way, the true intention of the legislature is more likely to be ascertained. ..."
[38]
In other words, the Board must exercise its statutory discretion in a manner that respects and promotes the purpose of the legislation.
[39]
The
Act
confers the discretion of reconsideration upon the Board but neither the
Act
nor the
Veterans Review and Appeal Board Regulations
, SOR/96-67, provide guidance as to the manner in which that discretion is to be exercised. In my opinion, that discretion is to be exercised in a manner consistent with the promotion of the statutory purpose.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Chief Justice Lamer said the following at paragraph 18:
"In considering whether [the trial judge] exercised his discretion reasonably, it is important that we not lose sight of Parliament's objectives in creating the new ... powers. ... [T]he underlying purpose and functions of the ... scheme provide considerable guidance in applying the principles of administrative law to the statutory provisions at issue here. ..."
[40]
I add that the statutory scheme of the
VRAB Act
is unique relative to other programs of redress, for example programs established pursuant to human rights legislation or to legislation governing the provision of employment-related benefits. In my opinion, it was wholly within the power and jurisdiction of Parliament to create this system of review and appeal that allows for the reconsideration of prior decisions, with a statutory direction for the favourable consideration of evidence to the benefit of an applicant for pension benefits. Again, I refer to sections 3 and 39 of the
VRAB Act
.
[41]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, Justice Teitelbaum repeatedly referred to these provisions and noted that it provided a guide to the interpretation of the
Act
. He further observed that the words of section 3 informed the Board in its requirements of evidence when a request for reconsideration was made. Indeed, Justice Teitelbaum expressed the opinion that sections 3 and 39 are highly relevant to the manner in which the Board is to exercise its discretion to reconsider. At page 291, he said the following:
"There is no definition of new evidence in the
Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act
. However, s. 39 of the
Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act
does establish general principles for how the VRAB is to dispose of evidence.
"Section 39 reads:
'In all proceedings under the Act, the Board shall:
(a) draw from all the circumstances of the case and all the evidence presented to it every reasonable inference in favour of the applicant or appellant;
(b) accept any uncontradicted evidence presented to it by the applicant or appellant that it considers to be credible in the circumstances; and
(c) resolve in favour of the applicant or appellant any doubt, in the weighing of evidence, as to whether the applicant or appellant has established a case.'
"In effect, s. 39 requires that when new and credible evidence is presented during a reconsideration proceeding, the VRAB has a duty to consider and weigh the evidence in the applicant's favour."
[42]
The Board, in this Interpretation decision, said that Justice Teitelbaum had "fully and deliberately" addressed the issue of due diligence in respect of new evidence. With respect, the Board is overstating the matter. Justice Teitelbaum addressed the issue of due diligence at page 292, as follows: "Despite the seeming belatedness of Dr. Murdoch's report, I do not find that the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. ..." Otherwise, he focused on the criteria of credibility, relevance and effect upon the ultimate outcome of the application for reconsideration, within the statutory framework.
V.
Conclusion
[43]
This application for judicial review addresses a general question of statutory interpretation, not the application of the law to particular facts. The issue before the Court is whether the Board may consider the principle of "due diligence" in deciding whether to exercise its discretion to reconsider an appeal decision, pursuant to subsection 32(1) and section 111 of the
VRAB Act
. In my opinion, that question can be answered affirmatively, subject to the provision that the Board's discretion must be exercised in a manner that conforms with the broad purpose of the
Act
and respects the intent and meaning of sections 3 and 39. Due diligence should not be given disproportionate weight.
[44]
Accordingly, this application for judicial review is dismissed. In the exercise of my discretion pursuant to Rule 400(1) of the
Federal Courts Rules
, SOR/98-106 as amended, there will be no order as to costs.
