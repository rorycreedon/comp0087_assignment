Gibson, J.
: These reasons arise from an application for a stay of the execution of a Deportation order issued against the applicant on March 21, 1995. The stay is sought pending determination:
- by this court of an application for leave and for judicial review of a decision of the respondent made pursuant to s. 70(5) of the
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, as amended (the "
Act
"), that the respondent is of the opinion that the applicant "... constitutes a danger to the public in Canada ..."; and
- by the Immigration Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of whether it has jurisdiction to consider the applicant's appeal from the Deportation Order issued against him.
[2]
In his application for leave and for judicial review, the applicant seeks the following relief: an order quashing the decision of the respondent that she is of the opinion that the applicant "... constitutes a danger to the public in Canada ..."; an order directing the Immigration Appeal Division to reinstate the applicant's appeal against the Deportation Order made against him; and an order declaring unconstitutional s. 70(5) of the
Act
in that it violates s. 7 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
. (Enacted as Schedule B to the
Canada Act 1982
, (U.K.) 1982, c. 11.)
[3]
The applicant was born in Italy in September, 1961. He came to Canada with his family at the age of three and became a permanent resident of Canada. Although he never acquired Canadian citizenship, he considers himself to be Canadian. His family members live in Canada. He does not speak Italian. He has lived in a common-law relationship for more than 14 years and, by that relationship, has an eleven year old son, who is a Canadian citizen. The applicant and his companion are expecting a second child.
[4]
The applicant has a long criminal record that includes a number of convictions for serious offences. His most recent convictions in November of 1994 were for four charges of break, enter and theft, break and enter with intent, attempted break and enter with intent and trafficking in a narcotic. The applicant's evidence is that he was not in fact convicted of trafficking in a narcotic on this particular occasion but rather of trafficking in a substance that he was passing off as a narcotic. In any event, these charges resulted in an aggregate sentence of twenty-one months. Earlier convictions included assaults, weapons convictions, robbery, obstruction of a Peace Officer, possession and trafficking of a narcotic and failures to comply with undertakings.
[5]
On January 29, 1996, the respondent's officials wrote to the applicant to advise that the Minister was considering issuance of an opinion pursuant to s. 70(5) of the
Act
, that the applicant is a danger to the public in Canada. The applicant was given an opportunity to make submissions in writing and did so, through counsel, on or about February 29, 1996. In his submissions, the applicant acknowledged a drug dependency, at least in the later stages to heroin, which he alleged to be at the base of his criminality. He described his efforts to gain control of his life in general and his addiction in particular. He indicated that a critical turning point occurred in March of 1995 when he underwent "... a profound religious conversion". He provided documentary evidence to support his new religious commitment, and to confirm his positive participation in drug rehabilitation programs and the support of his common-law wife and brother-in-law.
[6]
On February 20, 1996, following a detention review for the applicant held at the Metro Toronto West Detention Centre by an adjudicator within the respondent's department, the adjudicator wrote:
"The fact that Mr. Calabrese has a serious and extensive criminal record is not in dispute. However, I have thoroughly reviewed all written material submitted on his behalf since January 8, 1996 as well as the submissions made to me at this review. Given the very sincere and positive tone of those written and oral submissions, I am satisfied, on balance, that at this time Mr. Calabrese is not likely to reoffend and hence that he is not likely to pose a danger to the public."
In the result, the applicant was released from detention.
[7]
When the Minister's opinion was formed and the applicant was advised of that opinion, the applicant, knowing that he would again be detained, voluntarily reported to Immigration officials and was duly arrested. Following a further detention review, he was again released by the respondent's officials on April 8, 1996.
[8]
In order for the applicant to succeed on this application, the burden rests on him to establish three things: first, that there is a serious issue to be tried on his application for leave and for judicial review; second, that unless the stay is granted, the applicant will suffer irreparable harm; and third, that the balance of convenience favours the applicant rather than the respondent [see footnote 1].
[9]
For reasons substantially similar to those I wrote in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), I conclude that the applicant's application for leave and for judicial review on which this application is based raises a serious issue to be tried.
[10]
The irreparable harm that counsel for the applicant submitted the applicant would suffer if the stay were not granted arises largely from the applicant's separation from the professional and community-based supports that he is now reliant on in Canada to remain drug-free and, as a consequence, potentially crime-free, his complete lack of equivalent supports in the country to which he would be deported, Italy, and his lack of capacity to speak the Italian language with the resultant difficulties that he would face in attempting to establish anew in that country anything that would in any way approach the supports that he has in place in Canada.
[11]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), an equivalent application with a factual background not dissimilar to that in this matter, I wrote:
"A number of cases have held that loss of family support or potential family break-up is not of itself irreparable harm. But I am satisfied that loss of family support as well as the support of other elements of the professional and community support network now available to this applicant, of which he is so obviously in need and on which he has now demonstrated a willingness to rely, would, taken together, constitute irreparable harm to the applicant and, perhaps irrelevantly on an application such as this but I would hope not, for the community into which he would be parachuted."
In at least one respect, the case here is stronger since Mr. Hogan was facing deportation to England and would not have faced the disorienting linguistic difficulties that this applicant would face.
[12]
The following excerpt from the reasons of Mr. Justice McKeown in
Duve v. the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration
[see footnote 2], are reflective of the "number of cases" referred to in the quotation from
Hogan
that have held that loss of family support or potential family break-up is not of itself irreparable harm:
"I agree with Simpson, J., when she interprets irreparable harm in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), as follows:
' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), Mr. Justice MacKay concluded that, for the purposes of a stay application, irreparable harm implies the serious likelihood of jeopardy to the applicant's life or safety. This is a very strict test and I accept its premise that irreparable harm must be very grave and more than the unfortunate hardship associated with the breakup or relocation of a family.'
"In this case, the evidence went to the unfortunate hardship associated with the probable breakup of the applicant's family should the applicant be deported, but there is no evidence of jeopardy to the applicant's life or safety should he be returned to Fiji.
"Thus, there is no irreparable harm of the nature required to justify a stay of the execution of a deportation order."
On the facts before me, the evidence goes further than "... the unfortunate hardship associated with the probable breakup of the applicant's family ..." but certainly does not go to demonstrate jeopardy to the applicant's life or safety should he be returned, in this case, to Italy from whence he departed at a tender age.
[13]
Be that as it may, with great respect, I differ from my colleagues McKeown, J., and Simpson, J., as to the appropriate test. In the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case cited earlier, Heald, J.A., stated:
"... I am of the view that the applicant has met the irreparable harm test. As noted supra, the evidence is to the effect that if the applicant is deported now, there is a reasonable likelihood that the family business will fail and that his immediate family as well as others who are dependent on the family business for their livelihood will suffer. I think that at least a portion of this potential harm is irreparable and not compensable in damages. Accordingly, I conclude that the second component of the tripartite
American Cyanamid
test has been met."
While the elements of the potential irreparable harm on the facts before me are different from those cited by Mr. Justice Heald and more similar to those in
Hogan
supra, I am satisfied that the elements here present are of a parallel nature and that nature is far short of the nature or magnitude contemplated as being necessary by Mr. Justice McKeown and Madame Justice Simpson.
[14]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), relied upon by Madame Justice Simpson and cited in the quotation above from Mr. Justice McKeown's reasons in
Duve
, Mr. Justice MacKay stated:
"... Nevertheless, I do not believe these personal difficulties constitute irreparable harm, as serious as they may be for the applicant.
He will not be returned to a country where his safety or his life is in jeopardy
. If leave is granted on his application for judicial review, if the orders sought in that application are granted, and if the respondent on further review should determine that there are sufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds for him to remain in Canada, the deportation order now outstanding and to be implemented on March 23, 1992, may also be questionable and it will not be beyond the imagination of the respondent to arrange to admit the applicant to Canada should he seek to return." (underlining added by me for emphasis)
It would appear to be the underlined words in the quotation from the reasons in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> that have given rise to the very onerous test for irreparable harm adopted by some of my colleagues. With great respect, I conclude that too much is being read into the words of Mr. Justice MacKay. I interpret Mr. Justice MacKay's reference to personal jeopardy as simply a notation and illustration that, on the facts before him, no
irreversible
harm would befall the applicant; he could simply be allowed back into Canada without, in the meantime, suffering any kind of harm that would prevent him from picking up where he had left off. I regard this interpretation of Mr. Justice MacKay's words as consistent with the Court of Appeal decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , while a more stringent test for irreparable harm is difficult to regard as consistent with <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . I take some comfort in the position that I have adopted in interpreting <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> from the fact that, on another stay application
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), Mr. Justice MacKay himself found irreparable harm that arose from the separation of a family where one subject of a deportation order, a five-year old boy, might be separated from his mother who was not the subject of the deportation order, and who had a pending refugee claim. Mr. Justice MacKay concluded that, even if the separation were temporary, the harm would be more than inconvenience arising from family separation and, in fact, would be irreparable. Once again, I regard the result in
Singh
as consistent with the Court of Appeal's judgment in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Further, I regard that result as consistent with the position of the Supreme Court of Canada in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Q.A.C. 241, where Justices Sopinka and Cory stated:
"'Irreparable' refers to the nature of the harm suffered rather than its magnitude. It is harm which either cannot be quantified in monetary terms or which cannot be cured ..."
[15]
On the facts before me, I conclude that execution of the Deportation Order against the applicant would result in irreparable harm to the applicant.
[16]
Turning to the third element of the test, I find there are substantial elements of convenience or inconvenience in the applicant's favour that are directly related to the harm that he would suffer if he were now required to leave Canada. While it is beyond doubt that there is a public interest in the respondent fulfilling her responsibilities under the
Immigration Act
, and that that public interest is an element in the balance of convenience in favour of the respondent, I find that element to be substantially less than the convenience or inconvenience in the applicant's favour.
[17]
In the result, at the closing of the hearing of this matter before me in Toronto on May 13, 1996, I granted the applicant's application for a stay pending determination of the applicant's application for leave and, if leave be granted, pending final determination of the application for judicial review. That grant was made subject to the following condition:
"The respondent may apply for reconsideration of this order on evidence of breach by the applicant of any term of his release from immigration detention or on evidence of further criminal activity by the applicant."
[18]
The stay granted is unrelated to the time that may be required for determination by the Immigration Appeal Division of the issue of its jurisdiction in respect of the appeal brought before it by the applicant.
Application allowed.
