Tremblay-Lamer, J.
[Translation]: This is an application for judicial review under s. 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection
Act
, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the
Act
) of a negative decision by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board dated June 28, 2006, determining that the applicant is not a Convention refugee as defined in s. 96 of the
Act
or a person in need of protection under s. 97 of the
Act
, on the ground that he is a person referred to in Article 1F(a) and 1F(c) of the
United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
(the Convention).
[2]
The applicant, Kenny Merceron, is a citizen of Haiti. He states that he worked for the Haitian National Police (HNP) in Haiti from 1999 to 2003. He worked as a driver and body guard for a senior government minister.
[3]
He alleges that he was arrested and threatened with death for visiting one of his police officer friends who was imprisoned in the national penitentiary. After a minister intervened, he was released, and his service weapon was seized in August 2003. Fearing for his life, he travelled to Canada on August 16, 2003, and sought refugee protection in December 2004.
[4]
The RPD heard the claim on May 15, 2006. The respondent Minister intervened to ask the RPD to apply the exclusion clauses in Articles 1F(a) and 1F(c) of the Convention on the ground that the applicant was a member of the Haitian National Police from 1999 to 2003 after receiving four months of military training in 1998. The Minister was successful on this issue.
1. The appropriate standard of review
[5]
A decision by the RPD that certain acts fall within the definition of "crimes against humanity" is a question of law, and the standard of review is correctness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.).
[6]
The applicant's complicity in acts committed by the Haitian National Police and his exclusion under Article 1 of the Convention is a mixed question of law and fact. The standard of review is reasonableness simpliciter (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 302 N.R. 178; 2003 FCA 39;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 289 F.T.R. 1; 2006 FC 1.
2. Excluding the applicant
[7]
Section 98 of the
Act
provides that a person referred to in section E and F of Article 1 of the Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.
[8]
Paragraphs (a) and (c) of section F, which are relevant to this proceeding, read as follows:
"(a) He has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes;
. . . . .
(c) He has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations."
[9]
In
Harb
, above, the Federal Court of Appeal held that Article 1F(a) must be interpreted so as to include international instruments concluded since the Convention was adopted in 1951, including the definition of "crime against humanity" in the
Rome Statute
, which was adopted on July 17,1998, and came into effect on July 1, 2002.
[10]
Paragraph 7(1) of the
Rome Statute
(see Appendix) states that a "crime against humanity" is "committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population" and includes murder, torture, rape, persecution against any identifiable group on political, racial, national, ethnic or cultural grounds, and other inhumane acts of a similar character.
[11]
Paragraph 7(2) of the same
Statute
provides that such an attack against a population involves the multiple commission of acts referred to in paragraph 1 "pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organizational policy to commit such attack ...".
[12]
The situation envisaged is not one in which isolated incidents of international offences have occurred but where the commission of such offences is a
continuous and regular part of the operation
(
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.);
Moreno and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.); (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.)).
[13]
The onus is on the Minister to lead evidence demonstrating that there are "serious reasons for considering" that the applicant has been complicit in crimes against humanity (
Moreno
, above, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above). The applicable standard of proof is something more than mere suspicion but less than the balance of probabilities standard (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[14]
The purpose of Article 1F(c) is to exclude those individuals responsible for serious, sustained or systemic violations of fundamental human rights which amount to persecution in a non-war setting ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above).
Complicity by association
[15]
Complicity by association means that a person may be held responsible for crimes committed by others because of his or her close association with those who committed them ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above).
[16]
In such circumstances, it is the nature of the crimes alleged against the organization with which the person is associated that leads to his or her exclusion (
Harb
, above).
[17]
A refugee claimant is excluded for complicity if the claimant is a member of a group that has committed a crime against humanity, has knowledge of the group's activities,
actively supports the group
and has failed to disengage himself or herself from it at the earliest opportunity (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.)).
[18]
Essentially, complicity rests on the existence of a shared common purpose and the knowledge that all of the parties in question may have of it ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 205 N.R. 282 (F.C.A.)).
[19]
Mere membership
in an organization that commits international crimes is an insufficient basis on which to invoke the exclusion clause against the applicant ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above), unless the very existence of this organization is primarily directed to a limited, brutal purpose (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.)).
[20]
However, association with an organization responsible for international crimes may constitute complicity if there is personal and knowing participation or toleration of the crimes ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at paragraph 13).
[21]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Mr. Justice Yves deMontigny summarized the mental element required to establish complicity in crimes against humanity as follows:
"The mental element required to establish complicity in crimes against humanity has been characterized variously as 'shared common purpose', 'personal and knowing participation or toleration of the crimes', and participation in an organization knowing it commits crimes against humanity, when combined with a failure to stop the crimes or disassociate oneself."
[22]
Moreover, the case for an individual's complicity in international crimes committed by his or her organization is stronger if the individual member in question holds a position of importance within the organization. The closer one is to being a leader rather than an ordinary member, the more likely it is that an inference will be drawn that one knew of the crime and shared the organization's purpose in committing that crime. In such circumstances, an important factor to consider is evidence that the individual protested against the crime or tried to stop its commission or attempted to withdraw from the organization ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above).
Application to this case
[23]
The RPD analyzed the crimes and acts committed by the Haitian National Police and the
Chimères
and concluded that crimes against humanity were involved. However, the RPD did not find that the organization's existence was solely directed to a limited and brutal purpose, such that mere membership was a sufficient basis on which to invoke the exclusion clause ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above). Mr. Merceron could not be regarded as complicit in crimes against humanity based
solely
on the fact that he was a member of the Haitian National Police.
[24]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 199 F.T.R. 308 (T.D.), where the applicant was also a member of a police force recognized as an organization that committed international crimes (the Sri Lankan police), the Court found that mere membership in a police service does not meet the definition of "persecuting group" as interpreted in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above.
[25]
The RPD then had to determine the existence of a "shared common purpose" and "the knowledge that all of the parties in question may have of it" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above;
Moreno
, above).
[26]
The case law has established the factors to consider when determining whether there are serious reasons to believe that a claimant could be considered as an accomplice in the perpetration of crimes referred to in s. 1F of the Convention. These factors are: the method of recruitment, the claimant's position and rank in the organization, the nature of the organization, the knowledge of atrocities, the length of time in the organization and the opportunity to leave the organization (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 279 F.T.R. 296; 2005 FC 1306;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 277 F.T.R. 20; 2005 FC 1028).
[27]
In this case, the RPD analyzed and considered the following elements in determining whether the applicant was aware of the acts of violence and human rights violations committed by the police and the
Chimères
:
- He freely joined the police force in 1998 and underwent military training before returning to his position as a police officer;
- He would have learned about police violence from his brother, who was a police officer, and from his training in 1998;
- He was a member of the close protection unit for the office of the delegate for the west and an armed driver for a minister, and therefore was even more aware of the police violence at the time;
- He learned techniques for the defence of the country's security and knew that the police were suppressing the population in the name of defending the country's security;
- He acknowledged that he had heard about human rights abuses committed by police officers;
- He and the minister for whom he was a bodyguard often met with members of the
Chimères
, a (Translation) "militia group dedicated to the bloody suppression of opponents";
- As a police officer and bodyguard, he could not have been unaware of the brutal and violent repression by the security forces, but did not distance himself from them.
[28]
The fact that the applicant knew about the crimes was not in itself enough to establish that he shared a common purpose with the perpetrators of the crimes (
Collins
, above, paragraph 28).
[29]
As stated by Mr. Justice Joseph Robertson in
Moreno
, above, at paragraph 50:
"It is settled law that acts or omissions amounting to passive acquiescence are not a sufficient basis for invoking the exclusion clause."
[30]
The RPD had no evidence before it to infer from the applicant's mere knowledge that he shared a common purpose of consciously participating in serious crimes. The RPD did not refer to any fact, event or act by the applicant that would support a finding that he shared a common goal with the perpetrators of the crimes.
[31]
Despite the lack of evidence on this point, the RPD stated that the applicant (Translation) "would not have survived in such a situation if he had not been perceived as sharing the common purpose of abusing the people".
[32]
If that were the case, every member of the Haitian police force during that time, regardless of his or her position, would be excluded from the Convention.
[33]
The RPD could not find that the applicant was complicit in crimes against humanity without evidence to that effect.
[34]
For these reasons, I find that the RPD made a reviewable error. The application for judicial review is allowed, and the matter is remitted for reconsideration by a differently constituted panel.
