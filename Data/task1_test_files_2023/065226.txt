Reed, J.
: The dispute, which underlies this application, is a difference of opinion as to whether the polychlorinated biphenyls ("PCBs") present in the heating system of the "Irving Whale" should be pumped out, in whole or in part, before that barge is lifted from the bed of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, where it now rests. I must emphasize that the court's authority does not extend to deciding the respective merits of that disagreement. The court can and is only asked to decide whether the respondents have complied with the applicable environmental assessment legislation. Moreover, the situation is, indeed, unusual. The activity being evaluated is the removal of a known environmental hazard, not the addition of a potentially damaging feature to a previously benign environment.
Factual Circumstances
[2]
In 1970, the "Irving Whale" sank in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, about 60 kilometres from the north east tip of Prince Edward Island. The barge was carrying a cargo of 4,270 metric tons of heavy fuel oil. A large amount of oil leaked from the barge at that time. It fouled the beaches of the Magdalen Islands and some appeared on the coast of western Cape Breton. A clean-up of the spill ensued. Small quantities of oil, however, continued to leak from the sunken barge. The barge was inspected periodically. Remedial steps were taken to try to contain the leaks but these were not completely successful. It is estimated that the barge still contains about 3,113 metric tons of oil.
[3]
In 1989, following the collision of the "Ocean Service" and the "Nestucca", off the coast of the state of Washington, and following the grounding of the "Exxon Valdez" in Alaska, concern about pollution caused to the marine environment by oil spills intensified. In 1991-92, options were identified for dealing with the "Irving Whale": (1) doing nothing; (2) pumping out the oil from the barge but leaving it on the seabed; or, (3) raising the barge and removing it to dry dock where its cargo would be removed. Several reports were prepared. One, called the "Marex study", recommended pumping the oil from the barge. Another, the "Murray Fenton study", recommended raising the barge with its cargo still aboard and removing the cargo in dry dock.
[4]
Pumping the oil out and leaving the vessel on the seabed was ultimately rejected for a number of reasons. Not all the oil could be pumped out; a residual amount would remain. The viscosity of the oil in the cold, underwater temperatures, in which it is now found, would mean that it would be of "taffy-like" consistency. In order to pump out the oil, it would be necessary, first, to heat it to allow it to flow. It was decided that raising the barge would entail less risk to human life, less risk of accidental pollution by the oil and be less costly than the pump-out option. Studies were done with respect to the structure of the barge and it was concluded that it could easily withstand the stresses to which it would be subject on raising. Some oil was expected to have seeped from the barge onto the deck and, during the lift project, more could seep out. This would need to be cleaned up after the barge was raised.
[5]
An initial environmental assessment was prepared in accordance with s. 10 of the
Environmental Assessment and Review Process Guidelines Order
, SOR/84-467, ("
EARP Guidelines Order
"). The proposal assessed was the lifting of the barge, together with its cargo, and the transporting of the whole to Mulgrave, Nova Scotia. The Department of Transport (of which the Canadian Coast Guard was then a part) and the Department of the Environment were the initiating departments for the purposes of the assessment pursuant to the
EARP Guidelines Order
.
[6]
On April 13, 1994, the assessment was released for public comment. It carries the title
Initial Environmental Assessment Report on a Proposal for Dealing with the "Irving Whale"
. That assessment concluded that any potentially adverse environmental effects of the proposal were insignificant or mitigable with known technology. Under s. 12(c) of the
EARP Guidelines Order
, if an initiating department determines that a proposal will have insignificant adverse environmental effects or that the effects are mitigable with known technology, the proposal may proceed without further environmental assessment. [see footnote 1] The mitigation by known technology must be such as to render the anticipated adverse effects insignificant. [see footnote 2] Section 15 of the
Guidelines Order
requires the disclosure of information concerning the proposal to the public, and that the public be given an opportunity to respond. Section 13 provides that despite a s. 12 decision, if public concern about a proposal is such that a public review is desirable, the initiating department is to refer the proposal to the Minister for such review.
[7]
As noted, the initial assessment report was released on April 13, 1994. Public consultation and information sessions ensued. On August 5, 1994, the Minister of Transport and the Minister of the Environment announced the decision to proceed with the "Irving Whale" Recovery Project. The recovery would occur during the summer of 1995. It was scheduled for the summer months because adverse weather conditions at other times of the year make the activity impractical.
[8]
On December 9, 1994, a modification to the project was proposed: a change in the port of destination for the barge from Mulgrave, Nova Scotia, to Halifax. The modification involved an extra transit distance of 113 miles, which would take approximately eight additional hours of "steaming time". A supplementary environmental assessment pursuant to s. 10 of the
EARP Guidelines Order
was undertaken and a s. 12(c) decision was made. That assessment is entitled
Initial Environmental Assessment Report on a Proposal for Dealing with the "Irving Whale" - Modification of Plan for Destination Port
. The report concluded that "the potential adverse environmental effects that may be caused by this modification are insignificant or mitigable with known technology". The 30 day public comment period was provided for but no comments were received.
[9]
On January 19, 1995, the
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act
, S.C. 1992, c. 37, replaced the
EARP Guidelines Order
, see SOR/95-72 (January 18, 1995), SI/95-11 and SI/95-12. In April 1995, as a result of a governmental reorganization, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans became responsible for the Canadian Coast Guard. That department replaced the Department of Transport as one of the departments responsible for the Recovery Project. On June 9, 1995, a contract to raise the "Irving Whale" was awarded. During the days which followed, activity to organize the recovery of the "Irving Whale" took place. In the course of that activity, on June 26, 1995, J.D. Irving Ltd. advised the Department of the Environment that there were PCBs on the barge. Samples of sediment from around the barge and elsewhere were analyzed. It became clear that at least some of those PCBs had leaked into the marine environment; some were mixed with the oil that had escaped on the initial sinking of the barge and some appeared to have leaked independently of that event.
[10]
As a result of this new information, another environmental assessment was undertaken. On July 14, 1995, that study was released. It is entitled
Initial Environmental Assessment Report of a Supplementary Element of the Proposal to Recover the "Irving Whale" and Recover its Cargo of Bunker "C" Oil Removing and Disposing of PCB Material from the Oil Cargo Heating System of the Barge
. That study concluded that as long as the barge remained underwater, any attempt to determine the actual location and quantity of PCBs on the barge, or the precise origin of the PCB contamination that had already occurred, introduced the risk of releasing uncontrolled PCBs into the environment. As it was not feasible to determine the exact location and quantity of PCBs on board and given the stability of PCBs, their lack of corrosiveness and the design of the heating system, the report assumed that the bulk of the PCBs were still in the heating system or at least contained within the hull of the barge. The report stated that site remediation would be required once the barge was removed. The report concluded with a s. 12(c) determination, that the potentially adverse environmental effects of lifting the barge were insignificant or mitigable with known technology. The relevant portion of the report reads:
"The potential significance of this information [in the report] has been considered as a supplement to the initial environmental assessment of April, 1994. Based upon the information and evaluation presented in this document and related supporting materials,
DFO-CCG and DOE have determined, pursuant to s. 12(c) of the
EARPGO
, that the potentially adverse environmental effects that may be caused by this proposal are insignificant or mitigable with known technology
. The proposal, therefore, may proceed with mitigation. A final decision on the proposal will not be made until the requirements of ss. 13 (gauging public concern) and 15 (access to the proposal and an opportunity to respond) of the
EARPGO
have been met." (underlining added)
[11]
This decision led to litigation in this court (T-1738-95). The Ministers' decision to proceed with the recovery of the barge was consequently stayed until either a full hearing on the challenge to the July 1995 environmental assessment could be heard, by the court, or the relevant federal departments undertook a more in-depth environmental assessment. The court's order reads, in part:
"The Minister's decision of July 25, 1995, authorizing the raising of the 'Irving Whale' be stayed pending the determination by the Trial Division of the applicant's application for judicial review or until such time as a further initial assessment is made pursuant to ss. 10, 11 and 12 of the
Environmental Assessment and Review Process Guidelines Order
."
[12]
Pursuant to that order, a further assessment was conducted. This was released to the public on March 12, 1996. It is entitled
The Further Assessment of the Recovery of the "Irving Whale" in Light of the Presence of PCB's
("March 1996 Assessment"). The assessment states at page 83:
"DFO and EC conclude that all appropriate safety precautions have been planned for, and that the as-proposed project may proceed as planned in a safe and expeditious manner.
"The alternative to the recovery and removal of the 'Irving Whale' is the certainty that, over time, all the remaining PCBs and other substances on board will leak into the marine environment. Although the oil and the PCBs were initially reviewed in separate documents, much consideration has been given to the fact that at present they co-exist on the 'Irving Whale'. There is sufficient justification on both counts to remove this threat to the environment as expeditiously as possible.
DFO and EC therefore conclude that the environmental impact of the recovery of the 'Irving Whale' in light of the presence of PCBs is insignificant, or mitigable with known technology
." (underlining added)
[13]
Relevant information was made available to the public. Public information sessions were held and I accept the respondents' assertion that, in general, the public response to the proposal was positive. On April 16, 1996, the responsible Ministers announced that public concern did not warrant a s. 13 referral. They announced that the decision had been taken to proceed with the Recovery Project.
[14]
The applicant seeks a declaration that the respondents have not complied with the applicable environmental assessment law. The applicant submits that the applicable environmental assessment law is the
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act
, not the
EARP Guidelines Order
, and, alternatively, if the
EARP Guidelines Order
applies, the s. 12(c) determination, which was made by the initiating departments, was made without considering, fully, all adverse environmental effects and that the s. 12(c) decision is for other reasons, as well, unreasonable.
Applicable Environmental
Assessment Law
[15]
The applicant argues that the present project is governed by the
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act
and since the terms of that statute have not been complied with, the project cannot proceed. The
Act
came into force on January 19, 1995. It replaced the
EARP Guidelines Order
. Section 74 of the
Act
sets out the relevant transitional provisions. Since these are lengthy they are attached to these reasons as an Appendix. I will paraphrase them below. Since I find the French text of s. 74 easier to follow, the paraphrase is by reference to that text. As I understand s. 74, it provides:
(1)	The
EARP Guidelines Order
continues to apply in cases where public review panels have been established before the coming into force of the
Act
.
(2)	The
EARP Guidelines Order
continues to apply, in the case where an initial environmental assessment has been commenced under that order, up to the point at which the proposal is referred to the Minister for public review (after that point the
Act
becomes applicable).
(3)	When an initial assessment has been concluded under the
EARP Guidelines Order
but one of a number of events have occurred (one being that the project did not proceed) the initial assessment can be used for the purpose of complying with the requirements of the
Act
.
(4)	Certain provisions of the
Act
(with respect to the issuing of licences and permits) will not apply to activities or facilities which were in operation before June 22, 1984 (i.e. the date of the coming into force of the
EARP Guidelines Order
) unless modifications to that activity or facility are contemplated.
[16]
Subsections (1) and (4) are not applicable for present purposes. The respondents argue that subsection (2) applies because the initial assessment was commenced but was not completed until the issuance of the March 1996 Assessment. The applicant argues that subsection (3) applies because the initial assessment, in fact, two initial assessments - one of July 1994 and a supplemental one in December 1994 - were completed before the entry into force of the
Act
. A contract for the raising of the barge was entered into on June 9, 1995 but the project did not proceed.
[17]
In my view, subsection (2) contemplates the situation in which there is only one initial assessment report prepared with respect to a proposal. Subsection (3) deals with the situation in which, as a result of changes that occur to a proposal over time, there is more than one such report. Subsection (3) should be read in conjunction with s. 24 of the
Act
. In the present case, there was more than one initial assessment prepared. Two occurred before the
Act
came into force. One was prepared and issued after that date. As I read the
Act
, the March 1996 Assessment should have been prepared under the terms of the new legislation, although the two earlier reports could also be used for the purpose of assessing the proposal.
[18]
Counsel for the applicant argues that, in any event, the
Act
applies for another reason. The March 1996 Assessment states that an Ocean Dumping permit will be required in order to implement the recovery project. The issuance of such a permit triggers a requirement for an environmental assessment under the
Act
(ss. 2, 5, 59(f) and SOR/94-636). Thus, even if the March 1996 Assessment was correctly categorized as one to which subsection (2) applies, the obtaining of an Ocean Dumping permit will trigger the need to comply with the environmental assessments requirements of the
Act
. Counsel for the respondent, in argument, despite the statement to the contrary in the March 1996 Assessment, questioned whether such a permit was really necessary. He argues that no dumping will occur. The hazardous substances are already in the water. The only evidence before me is the statement in the March 1996 Assessment that one is required. If this is so then the requirements of the
Act
prevail independently of the applicant's obtaining from the court last August an order for an assessment pursuant to the
EARP Guidelines Order
.
[19]
Even if the
Act
applies, however, counsel for the respondents argues that it would not be appropriate, in this case, to grant the applicant a declaration to that effect. Nor should I grant an order quashing the decision to proceed with the project. It is argued that such relief should be denied because the court order sought and obtained by the applicant, last August, was brought on the basis that the
EARP Guidelines Order
still applied, and the applicant has never, before now, raised an argument to the contrary. There would appear to have been a mistake of law made last August by both the applicant and the respondents in not considering whether the
Act
then applied. I quote from the respondents' written argument:
"125. ... it is too late for the applicant to raise the
CEAA
issue credibly. In 1995, the applicant and another litigant sought and received an order from the court requiring 'further initial assessment made pursuant to ss. 10, 11 and 12 of the
EARPGO
'. It never suggested that the environmental assessment focussing on the PCBs done in 1995 was wrong because it was done according to the
EARPGO
and not the
CEAA
. The applicant got what it asked for. In effect, by raising this attack for the first time in 1996, the applicant is saying that it was wrong in what it sought from the court in 1995. It is saying that the orders of Richard, J., and McGillis, J., were wrong (although never appealed). And it is saying that the respondents are wrong because they obeyed orders of this Honourable Court.
"126. It is trite to state that the prerogative relief sought by the applicant is discretionary. Unreasonable delay and detrimental reliance can be bars to a discretionary remedy."
[20]
I have considered the authorities to which counsel for the respondents referred:
Homex Realty and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , esp. at 1033ff and S.A. deSmith,
Judicial Review of Administrative Action
(4th Ed. 1980). I am persuaded that the present case is a situation in which there is discretion to refuse the remedy sought. The applicant's conduct in failing to assert in its applications to the court, at an earlier time, the correct law, and in obtaining from the court an order based on the earlier law, precludes it from obtaining the declaration it now seeks and a quashing of the decision to proceed. I make no determination as to whether an Ocean Dumping permit is required. That issue was not fully argued before me. The March 1996 Assessment assumes that a permit is required.
[21]
In addition, there is discretion to refuse to grant prerogative relief when the ground on which the relief is sought can be characterized as an inconsequential error. That is, if, the error would have no real effect on the final outcome, the court does not exercise its authority to set the decision in question aside. As I read the new
Act
, that would seem to be the effect of the error alleged in this case. Under both the
EARP Guidelines Order
and the
Act
, initial environmental assessments, by initiating departments (federal authorities), are required. Under both, if the result of that process is a decision that the proposal will have insignificant adverse environmental effects or ones that are mitigable with known technology so as to render them insignificant, the proposal may proceed without further assessment. I do not think the continued reference to s. 12(c) of the
EARP Guidelines Order
, rather than to s. 18 of the
Act
, amounts to much more than a technical error. I do not think any substantive difference results therefrom. It is true that s. 16 of the
Act
sets out a list of the various factors which must be addressed in an environmental assessment pursuant to that
Act
. There is no such specific list found in the
Guidelines Order
. Nevertheless the factors identified in the
Act
have been addressed, if not specifically within the March 1996 Assessment, at least in related documents. Accordingly, it would be inappropriate to grant the relief sought by this applicant on the basis that the
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act
and not the
EARP Guidelines Order
applies.
March 1996 Assessment
[22]
The applicant argues that the decision that the project will result in insignificant adverse environmental effects or effects which are mitigable by known technology so as to become so, should be set aside because: (1) the environmental assessment did not fully consider all the relevant factors; (2) it is for other reasons also unreasonable.
[23]
With respect to the appropriate test to be applied by a court on judicial review I agree with counsel for the applicant that the test is one of reasonableness, not correctness. Counsel for the respondents seemed to argue that a more stringent test must be applied because the text of s. 18 of the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, states that the Trial Division "may grant relief ... if it is satisfied that the [decision maker] ... based its decision ... on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it". That text must be read in the historical and jurisprudential context in which it was drafted. For reasons similar to those set out in
Singh and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), I remain of the view that the text of s. 18 equates to what is now referred to in the jurisprudence as the "reasonableness test". This is certainly the test that many, many decisions of this court have applied on judicial review.
[24]
Section 3 of the
EARP Guidelines Order
states that in doing an assessment the initiating department shall "ensure that the environmental implications ... are fully considered". The applicant argues that this has not been done because: (1) there has been no determination as to how the PCBs escaped the closed heating system of the barge - tests, which are available to ascertain the presence or absence of PCBs in various parts of the barge, have not been and will not be used; (2) the decision has been made to lift the barge and worry about PCB clean-up later; (3) there has been inadequate consideration given to the environmental consequences, if a very large quantity of PCBs are released into the water; (4) there has been inadequate or inconsistent regard paid to the safety of divers - the report rejects further testing with respect to the present location of the PCBs for reasons of diver safety but does not assess this factor in the context of the PCB clean-up required after the barge is raised; (5) there has been inadequate attention paid to the technical and practical ability to recover all PCBs which may escape; (6) there is inadequate analysis of the likelihood of a major spill occurring; (7) contingency plans are focused on oil spills not a PCB spill; (8) the risk assessment of the various options (e.g., pump-out as opposed to lift-as-is) is entirely subjective.
[25]
On reading the material which has been submitted as evidence, it is clear that there are a significant number of unknowns. These arise, however, from the nature of the project in question, not from a failure of the respondents to consider them. The barge rests on the bed of the Gulf. It is not possible to ascertain the condition of the underside of its hull until it is raised, at least a short distance. With respect to the failure to determine how the PCBs escaped and the failure to use tests to ascertain how much remains within the barge, and where it is located, the first is by no means an easy matter and, with respect to the second, there would appear to be sound reasons for not engaging in what is called "intrusive" testing. One of the studies prepared for the March 1996 Assessment is a document entitled
Potential Consequences of a PCB Spill from the Barge "Irving Whale" on the Marine Environment of the Gulf; DFO Science Branch, 1996
. It discusses, at pages 15 to 18 the possible sources of the leaked PCBs:
"Some PCBs were apparently released from the barge with the initial oil spill that followed the sinking in 1970. Indeed, analyses of old residual oil samples dating from 1970 and collected in 1995 from various burial sites on beaches of the Magdalen Islands revealed PCB concentrations up to 127.2 and 32.3 ug. - g
-1
in oil and sand-oil mixtures respectively (see Appendix IV). Although PCBs and Bunker C oil would not tend to mix together under the conditions currently prevailing around the 'Irving Whale' (see s. 3.1), the high temperature of both products at the time of the sinking undoubtedly allowed for some mixing to occur during the initial spill. The total amount of PCBs contained in plastic bags recovered from the initial spill in 1970 and buried on beaches of the Magdalen Islands has been estimated at 50 kg.
. . . . .
"PCB analyses on sediment samples collected in the vicinity of the 'Irving Whale' show that sediments in the immediate location are contaminated with PCBs (Fig. 8). Concentrations of Aroclor 1242 in sediments were highest just beside the 'Irving Whale', reaching 890 ug - g
-1
, and decreased rapidly with distance from the barge. However, an area with elevated PCB concentrations in sediments can be distinguished east and southeast of the barge. This distribution pattern of PCBs in sediments is consistent with the orientation of both short-term currants and the residual flow pattern in the vicinity of the barge (see s. 2.1).
"These observations could result either from material continually or intermittently leaking from the barge, or they could simply reflect the blocking action of the barge on local currants following a single leak at the time of sinking. This blocking effect would limit the dispersion of material on the ocean floor. PCB concentrations would thus remain high even without additional leakage, only because of the fact that Aroclor 1242 would be dispersing at a much lower rate than in the surrounding area. ...
. . . . .
"Combining observations with the estimated spatial extent of contamination around the 'Irving Whale', the total amount of PCBs associated with sediments around the barge is approximately 37.5 kg, which is low compared to the initial load present in the 'Irving Whale' at the time of the sinking. Such an estimate suggests that only small quantities of PCBs may have leaked out or that some PCBs may have been dispersed away over the last 25 years or so. Many dispersion mechanisms may be involved in this process, including: 1) transport with fine-grained suspended particles to which PCBs tend to associate; 2) the formation of colloids carried away by currants; 3) water solubilization which is however low in the case of PCBs; 4) sediment bedload transport; and 5) biological transport.
"An examination of the composition of PCBs as well as levels of chlorobenzenes in sediments around the 'Irving Whale' suggests that one or several other leaks of PCBs, in addition to the initial spill in 1970, may have occurred since the sinking. ...
. . . . .
"Based on the preceding observations, it appears that PCBs may have leaked out continuously or at least on one other occasion since 1970. On the one hand, some PCBs were released with the initial oil spill that occurred in 1970 following the sinking, and were carried away with the oil slick, some of which were deposited on the Magdalen Islands. On the other hand, the presence in sediments just beside the barge of chlorobenzenes and low-chlorinated PCBs, the latter in proportions which are similar to the composition of Aroclor 1242, suggests that another spill of some PCBs may also have occurred in recent years. However, it is not possible to state whether PCBs may have leaked out continuously or intermittently, and consequently one cannot give an estimate of total amounts that were released since the sinking. In summary, relatively small amounts of PCBs have been found in sediments around the barge (∼ 37.5 kg) and in residues recovered in the Magdalen Islands in 1970 (∼ 50 kg). In addition, PCBs were not detected in oil samples collected in the barge and in surface slicks resulting from intermittent leaks since 1970 (see Appendix III)."
[26]
With respect to testing for the location and quantity of PCBs remaining in the vessel, the recommendations of a consultant group hired by the respondents advised that, while testing for the location of the PCBs was possible, testing for quantity was simply not a sensible approach: [see footnote 3]
"13.13 It is important to note that the testing and sampling procedures listed in paragraphs 13.9 through 13.12 are designed to confirm the presence or absence of PCB heating fluid at various locations in the heating system. Developing procedures to determine the exact amount in each location may be counter-productive in light of the overall objective. The goal is to contain heating fluid, in whatever amount, during the salvage operation. The team is convinced that any attempt to precisely measure the PCB heating fluid remaining in the barge risks release and contamination which could and should be avoided."
[27]
Those consultants also advised that while testing for location was possible, such activity could result in more adverse environmental consequences than not doing so:
"... Possible contamination could result from any of the intrusive sampling techniques described. It may be an error to assume main deck heating system valves are still operable after 25 years submerged. Considering the possibility of existing valve damage and internal bi-metallic interfaces, it is not unreasonable to assume they might fracture or their packing glands might fail when the handwheels are turned. Additionally, the type of pipe used for the ring mains, welded rather than seamless, may not withstand 'swaging' without a fracture or plugging without a leak. If 'swaging' is considered, testing with similar 4-inch welded piping should be performed topside before using this procedure. Ring main testing carries the highest risk factor. If a single valve on any of the 12 cargo tank coils is damaged, or the pipe fractures/leaks, during the tapping procedure outlined, this testing process could permit up to 130 gallons of fluid in the adjoining ring main (the system's high point) to drain into the sea. The fluid might, or might not, contain PCBs. Since ring main testing carries the highest risk factor, visual inspection, patching any suspicious areas, and covering selected valves with bags should suffice.
"14.3 Potential PCB pollution from the engine and/or pump room sampling regimes can be minimized by maintaining small sample sizes.
"14.4 Any past damage to individual tank coils has two possible consequences; either the fluid has leached out a hole in the tank bottom over the years or the fluid is contained within the tank.
"14.5 Our primary recommendation to control potential PCB pollution during this stage is to limit intrusive testing to two samples, one each from the engine and pump rooms, and forego testing the ring main and 12 cargo tank coils. The majority of heating fluid should be found in the engine and pump rooms.
"14.6 'In Situ' Removal: Removing the heating fluid from the 'Irving Whale' while submerged on the bottom constitutes a greater environmental risk than the testing/sampling procedures. It also puts the divers at significant risk, should there be a rupture/failure, and their saturation suits contact the heating fluid (refer to ss. 15.3 and 15.4). ..."
[28]
I have set out the above lengthy passages from the Assessment because they illustrate that considerable consideration has been given to aspects of the proposal that are being questioned. Visual examination of the part of the heating system that is easily accessible will be undertaken and any defects found patched. Two tests for PCBs are to be undertaken before the attempt to lift the barge is commenced: one from the engine room and one from the pump room. These measures were recommended by the consultants and will be performed as they suggest.
[29]
With respect to the consequences of a release of significant quantities of PCBs into the marine environment, the material that was placed before the Ministers is extensive. It is clear, there is an awareness that the release of substantial quantities of PCBs could result in severe environmental consequences. This is well documented.
[30]
The respondents plan to raise the barge a short distance in order to examine the underside of the hull. If there is significant damage, the barge will be returned to the seabed and another option, presumably the pump-out option, will be tried. The respondents know that the greatest stress on the barge will be when it is first moved free of the seabed and, secondly, when it breaks free of the surface of the water. As noted, if there are difficulties at the first stage, the plan is to return the barge to its place on the seabed. To avoid difficulties at the surface of the water, the barge is to be raised out of the water by using a submersible barge (transport vessel). The stress on the barge will be monitored during its upward journey to ensure that acceptable stress limits are not exceeded. The respondents are also aware that there is a possibility that human error can cause a serious disaster. This is not of course expected but realistically it is a possibility. It has been thought about and contingency plans have been and are continuing to be developed. The contingency plans as I understand them relate to both the spillage of oil and of PCBs.
[31]
With respect to the alleged inadequate or inconsistent regard being paid to diver safety, there is repeated reference in the material to diver safety being of paramount importance. This is one of the reasons that the pump-out option was rejected. The difference between the applicant and the respondent on this point is that the applicant expects a major spill of PCBs while the respondents do not. It is their judgment that the hull of the barge is strong and will withstand the lift process and that PCBs, being heavier than water, will by and large remain within the barge.
[32]
There is limited information in the Assessment about occasions on which there has been a clean up of PCB spills in the marine environment. The applicant notes that the one reference which exists and which seems to be particularly relevant, indicates that extensive diver time would be required to accomplish a clean up. At the same time, the two situations (that referred to in the Assessment and the present one) may not really be comparable: the condition of the bed in the two cases is different; the current conditions may be different; the depth of the water is different. Also diver safety, in the Assessment, was not judged merely on the basis of the length of time that would have to be spent under water but also on the nature of the potential contact with PCBs to which the divers could be exposed.
[33]
One can read the vast quantity of material which has been produced with respect to the Recovery Project, and one can find what appear to be weaknesses. For example, the applicant notes that while the Searle report rejects the pump-out option by the means that were proposed in the Marex study, it is not so firmly critical of a pump-out option that uses different technology. In addition, a reader is left with questions about the firmness of some of the views in that report. This is particularly so when one notes that the March 1996 Assessment seems to overstate the report's. The March 1996 Assessment states that:
"Because of the risks of heating fluid leakage and the risks to diver safety inherent in both suction methods considered, it has been
strongly
recommended to lift the barge as is and deal with the PCBs on the surface (Searle and Associates, 1996)". (underlining added)
[34]
The Searle report itself, however, is somewhat more restrained. It states:
"3.1 Our review indicated that the salvage operation, as currently planned,
is feasible and can be accomplished
without harm to the environment or personnel involved in its execution [specific recommendations for enhancing the safety follow].
. . . . .
"4.1 The review has convinced the S & A team that, of the options available, salvage by lifting the 'Irving Whale' intact
is the best one
. Further, if the recommendations listed above and discussed more completely on the body of this report are carried out, the Salvor
should be able to complete the barge's salvage without undue danger
to human safety and the environment." (underlining added)
[35]
I note as well that this report, which is a major underpinning of the March 1996 Assessment, was not commissioned from the consultants until January 22, 1996. The consultants point out that this occurred
orally
at that time. They only received the relevant documentation and terms of reference as of that date and they were expected to be ready for discussions by January 31, 1996. The terms of reference required the report to be completed by January 31, 1996. The short period of time given to the consultants, undoubtedly, explains the report's many short comings.
[36]
One could wish that the risk analysis in the March 1996 Assessment was a bit more fulsome with respect to how and why the numbers were assessed for the various factors. And, it is troubling to find a reference to a contract having been given to Bio-Response Systems Limited, "to provide an evaluation of the potential risk associated with this project with respect to the various possible impact scenarios and recovery options", and, then, to find that no independent document was ever prepared. At the same time, when one looks at the material as a whole, it seems clear that the risk assessment is an attempt to quantify the judgment of individuals, knowledgeable in the field, in an area where quantification is simply not possible. This is expressly admitted in the documentation.
[37]
The applicant is very, very concerned that the respondents are pursuing the wrong approach in dealing with the "Irving Whale". The respondents have made certain decisions, on the basis of their best judgment. At the end of the day, who is right will only be ascertained after the Recovery Project has been either successfully or unsuccessfully carried out. At the moment, no one, neither the applicant, nor the respondents, nor the court has the benefit of what will become hindsight. Decisions have to be made on the basis of existing information. In reviewing the respondents' decision to proceed I cannot find that they have neglected to consider fully all relevant factors.
[38]
Another basis on which the applicant challenges the decision to proceed with the Recovery Project is that its implementation will involve a breach of law. It is anticipated that some PCBs will escape in the lift process. The March 1996 Assessment states, at page 57:
"... When the barge sank in 1970, it is possible that some PCBs may have been released as the barge sank and when it hit the bottom. It also appears that over the last 25 years there may have been one or more leaks from the barge. The total PCBs released is estimated at this time to be approximately 90 kg (DFO, 1996). To be conservative, for this scenario
it is assumed that the controlled recovery of the barge would release a similar amount of PCBs to that released during the sinking of the barge and over the last 25 years, when no controls were in place
.
"The two other scenarios are 'worst-case' scenarios. Both worst-case scenarios are characterized as highly unlikely to occur." (underlining added)
[39]
The applicant argues that the release of PCBs, which may occur on the lifting of the barge, contravenes the
Fisheries Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-14, the
Canadian Environmental Protection Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. 16 (4th Supp.), particularly the
Chlorobiphenyls Regulations
, SOR/91-152, as well as the federal government's
Toxic Substances Management Policy
.
[40]
Insofar as the
Fisheries Act
is concerned, counsel for the respondents argues that the lifting of the "Irving Whale" will not "deposit" a deleterious substance into the water. That substance has already been deposited. He argues that even if it could be so characterized, it is counter-intuitive to think that any prosecution would be contemplated. The release of some PCBs into the water has to be assessed in the context of the certain release of all the PCBs, over time, if no remedial action is taken.
[41]
The
Canadian Environmental Protection Act
and the
Chlorobiphenyls Regulations
, s. 6, provide that no more than 1 gram per day of PCBs may be released into the environment. This is expressed to pertain "in respect of any item of equipment or any receptacle or material containing equipment in the course of the operation, servicing, maintenance, decommissioning, transporting or storage of ... heat transfer equipment". Counsel for the respondents acknowledges that the Recovery Project involves the transporting of the described equipment. The lifting of the "Irving Whale" seems likely to offend the
Chlorobiphenyls Regulations
. But, the option of leaving the barge where it is, is not a reasonable option. The evidence before the court does not establish that the pump-out option, which the applicant prefers, will necessarily lead to any lower level of PCB pollution than the lifting of the vessel-as-is. In the absence of such evidence, I do not see how I could characterize the respondents' decision, even though it will offend the
Chlorobiphenyls Regulations
, as unreasonable.
[42]
The
Toxic Substances Management Policy
expressly addresses the circumstances of a clean-up of existing pollution:
"... management plans will consider the elimination of ... [the] substance, based on an analysis of risks, costs and benefits. Where the benefits to the ecosystem or to human health of removing the substance outweigh clean-up costs -- including the possibility of further environmental degradation -- remediation will be considered. Otherwise, management strategies will focus on minimizing exposure and the site's potential risks."
The respondents' decision in the present case accords with that policy.
[43]
I turn then to the essential decision of the March 1996 Assessment. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the Department of the Environment have concluded that, barring some highly unlikely worse case scenario, no more than 90 kg of PCBs will be released into the marine environment as a result of the raising of the "Irving Whale". The Assessment concludes "the environmental impact of the recovery ... in light of the presence of PCBs is insignificant, or mitigable with known technology ...". While the wording does not track the earlier reports, which stated that the "potential adverse effects" that might be caused by the recovery project "are insignificant ...", argument by all parties has proceeded on the basis that the conclusion is the same as those rendered previously, that is that it is a s. 12(c) conclusion. The departments conducted extensive analyses, which are set out in the report, of the effect of releasing PCBs into the environment at the particular location in question. The departments concluded that the effects of releasing that quantity of PCBs into the environment would be insignificant or could be made so by known mitigation technology.
[44]
Environmental assessment legislation does not prevent projects for which the effects are unknown being undertaken. It especially does not prevent projects where, although the adverse consequences may be significant, those consequences are nevertheless justifiable. It does require, in such circumstances, however, a different procedure than has been followed in this case - a procedure that focuses on the justifiability of the risks being taken. Under the
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act
, s. 20(c), for example, provides for referral of the project to a mediator or a review panel.
[45]
The position being taken by the relevant departments in this case, is that the potentially adverse environmental effects that may arise from the recovery of the "Irving Whale" are not of such an uncertain nature. The departments have concluded that potentially adverse consequences are insignificant. This conclusion is based on extensive information, documentation, analysis and expertise. On the basis of the material on the file, I could not conclude that the decision is unreasonable. At the same time, if there has been a lack of candidness about the degree of uncertainty which exists, the quantity of PCBs likely to be released or about the potentially adverse consequences arising therefrom, which judgments form the basis of the Assessment that has been given, then, this court, and perhaps the public too, will have been misled.
[46]
For the reasons given the application will be dismissed.
Application dismissed.
