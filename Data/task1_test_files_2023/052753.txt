Summary:
This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary.
[1]
Pinard, J.
: This is a motion on behalf of the applicant for an Order staying the exclusion order made against him in this matter until the final disposition of his Application for Leave and for Judicial Review.
[2]
I have serious doubts as to the existence of a serious issue in this matter. However, the motion can otherwise be dismissed on the ground that the applicant has failed to establish that he will suffer irreparable harm if he is returned to his country of origin, the United States of America.
[3]
Irreparable harm must be much more substantial harm and more serious than purely personal inconvenience (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Q.L.) (T.D.) and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) (C.A.)). As my colleague Pelletier J., as he then was, stated in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) (T.D.):
[21] . . . if the phrase "irreparable harm" is to retain any meaning at all, it must refer to some prejudice beyond that which is inherent in the notion of deportation itself. To be deported is to lose your job, to be separated from familiar faces and places. It is accompanied by enforced separation and heartbreak. . . .
[4]
In this case, mere inconvenience to the applicant's common-law relationship in Ottawa is clearly insufficient to establish irreparable harm. There is no serious likelihood that the applicant's life or safety would be jeopardized. Finally, even if the applicant is removed from Canada, he will still be in a position to pursue his judicial review application. The applicant's counsel can certainly receive evidence and instructions from his client from the United States of America. If the applicant is ultimately successful in these proceedings, it is unlikely that it will be impossible for him to come back to Canada.
[5]
Furthermore, given the above circumstances, the balance of convenience favours the respondent, as the latter is under a statutory obligation to ensure that the applicant's removal is carried out as soon as reasonably possible (subsection 48(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27).
[6]
Consequently, the motion is dismissed.
