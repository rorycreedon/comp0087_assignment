MLB unedited judgment
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 
Federal Court of Canada
Trial Division
Hargrave, Prothonotary
April 6, 2000.
Counsel:
Nicholas Bonamy, on his own behalf;
Keitha Richardson, for the defendant.
Solicitors of Record:
Morris Rosenberg, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, for the defendant.
Summary:
This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. This case was originally cited as [2000] F.T.R. TBEd. MY.081.
[1]
Hargrave, Prothonotary
: The Plaintiff, in this action, seeks a declaration that the Defendant failed to deal, in a proper way, with his request for review of his conviction, pursuant to section 690 of the
Criminal Code
, which section is an extension of the royal prerogative of mercy.
[2]
By the present motion in writing, the Defendant seeks to strike out the Statement of Claim on the basis that the Minister, in dealing with the request for mercy, acted as a federal board or tribunal, referring to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  in which the decision of the Minister of Justice, coming out of a review under section 690 of the
Criminal Code
, was said to be unfair. This became the subject matter of a judicial review proceeding. In
Thatcher
Mr. Justice Rothstein, as he then was, noted that decisions made pursuant to royal prerogative are subject to judicial review. He referred to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , an on point decision in which Madame Justice Reed found decisions made by the Minister of Justice, under what is now section 690 of the
Criminal Code
, are subject to judicial review.
[3]
Such judicial review is proper because a Minister can be, and here the Crown submits is, acting as a federal board or tribunal. I accept that as a correct analysis.
[4]
The next step is that a declaration against a federal board or tribunal may only be obtained on an application for judicial review, and not by an action: sections 18(1)(a) and 18(3) of the
Federal Court Act
.
[5]
The Plaintiff's position on this point is that judicial review is not applicable because the Minister has made no decision. Clearly a decision is required as a foundation for judicial review. Yet there has been a decision by the Crown and specifically by the Department of the Minister of Justice, not to review the Plaintiff's case. Were the matter to end here the Defendant might well have demonstrated it to be plain and obvious that the claim for a declaration could not succeed as an action. However, there is a further aspect.
[6]
The Crown, pursuing the fact that this matter should have been begun by way of judicial review, refers to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  for the proposition that injunctive or declaratory relief against a federal board or tribunal may only be obtained pursuant to section 18(3) of the
Federal Court Act
. That case was also authority for the proposition that an action may not be converted into a judicial review proceeding. That was a truism at the time <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> was decided, for then it was only possible to convert a judicial review application into an action by way of section 18.4(2) of the
Federal Court Act
.
[7]
Since <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the
Federal Court Rules
have been revised. The Plaintiff refers to Rule 57 of the
1998 Federal Court Rules
which provides:
"57.
Wrong Originating Document
- an originating document shall not be set aside only on the ground that a different originating document should have been used."
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  T-509-90, the Court gave effect to Rule 57 and notwithstanding that the action had been commenced many years previously, gave the Plaintiff leave to convert the action into a judicial review application through the process of filing a new originating notice of motion. Following this precedent in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  as an action, but which ought to have been a judicial review proceeding. Instead, I allowed a grace period within which the Plaintiff might apply both to convert the action to an application and for any necessary time extension.
[8]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  action into an application for judicial review:
"In my view, Rule 57 can be applied to convert an action to a judicial review application. Moving parties should have filed an application for judicial review instead of an action. This irregularity can be remedied. [unreported reasons of 30 Dec 1999]"
That being said Mr. Justice Blais noted that an extension of time for commencing judicial review proceedings was required, an extension which was not forthcoming.
[9]
In the present instance, the Plaintiff is clearly out of time for a judicial review application, the decision not to review his plea for mercy apparently having been made 3 December 1999 and communicated to the Plaintiff on 17 December 1999. The Plaintiff would thus have to couple any Rule 57 motion, to convert this action to a judicial review application, with an application for an extension of time as is provided for in section 18.1(2) of the
Federal Court Act
. This is neither an automatic nor an easy remedy, but it is a possible remedy. Thus I am not prepared to hold that this action is plainly and obviously futile.
ORDER
[10]
The Plaintiff may have 45 days within which to seek a time extension to commence judicial review proceedings and a conversion of this action into an application for judicial review pursuant to Rule 57. If the application has not been served and filed within that time, the action shall be deemed struck out, without leave to amend.
