Collier, J.
[orally]: In this action, the Attorney General of Canada has nominated William P. Kelly, the Associate Deputy Minister of Labour, as the officer to be examined for discovery on behalf of the defendant Crown. The plaintiff seeks an order of the court nominating Pierre Cadieux, the Minister of Labour, as the appropriate officer.
[2]
The action is for a declaration that the Maintenance of Ports Operation Act, 1986 S.C. 1986, chapter 46 is inconsistent with the provisions of the Charter.
[3]
Paragraph 6 of the statement of claim is as follows:
"6. The Act purports to prohibit and/or restrict the plaintiffs and persons represented by them from bargaining collectively, and from lawfully withdrawing their services in combination, in concert or in accordance with a common understanding and it is inconsistent with the plaintiff's freedom of association guaranteed by the Charter."
[4]
The plaintiffs say the Minister himself is more appropriate than the deputy named. The argument runs this way: this is a Charter case; a serious issue will arise under s. 1 (whether the legislation is within
"... such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.")
The Minister introduced the bill in Parliament which resulted in the impugned legislation; the Minister is the one who can state the policy behind the legislation.
[5]
It was further contended the cases in this court, and the Supreme Court of Canada, dealing with rule 465(1)(c) be treated with caution, in that they preceded the Charter and did not involve Charter, or similar, arguments.
[6]
The cases referred to are:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.); [1977] 2 S.C.R. 566; 13 N.R. 624 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.).
[7]
I digress at this point to deal with two stated objections on behalf of the defendant: (1) this court has no jurisdiction to override the nomination made, (2) the Minister is not an officer of the Crown. Those points have been decided adversely to the defendant in the reasons given by the Federal Court of Appeal in the C.A.E. case. The Supreme Court of Canada set aside the Court of Appeal's formal decision on the grounds the Minister there sought to be examined was no longer a Minister. The court left open the question whether a Minister is a departmental or other officer. It specifically expressed no opinion as to whether this court was precluded from entertaining an application for the nomination of an officer other than the one nominated by the Attorney General.
[8]
On the basis of the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal, I rule against the two objections raised by the defendant.
[9]
I return to the merits as to whether the Minister should be the appropriate person.
[10]
In my view, the Charter does not change the considerations to be taken into account.
[11]
The Minister, and his and other departments, may have formulated the bill introduced. The Minister may have had some say in executive policy decisions. He may have introduced the original bill. But it was Parliament who ultimately decided the policy and passed the statute.
[12]
It seems to me the nominee here can satisfactorily provide the objective facts in issue in this litigation. He is required to inform himself to answer proper questions put to him.
[13]
Further, the object of the examination is to elicit facts, not subjective opinions or policies. Rule 464(16) provides:
"Upon examination for discovery person under paragraph (5), he shall answer any question as to any fact within his knowledge that may prove or tend to prove or disprove or tend to disprove any unadmitted allegation of fact in any pleading filed by the assignee or the examining party."
[14]
The nominee in this case can, to my mind, satisfactorily fulfill that requirement.
[15]
That part of the motion is dismissed.
[16]
The plaintiffs ask that the examination for discovery, whoever the officer, be in Vancouver. The defendant objects on two grounds: (1) the plaintiff has not filed, as required by rule 465(3), a rule 447 list of documents, (2) the discovery should be held near the place where the nominee resides, in this case, Ottawa.
[17]
I shall direct the plaintiff to file and serve a 447 list of documents on or before July 22nd, 1987.
[18]
As I understand it, the parties will agree on the date and time for the examination. An appointment can then issue.
[19]
I also direct the examination for discovery be held in Vancouver. The Crown, in my view, is in a different position than subjects involved in litigation in this court. The Crown resides everywhere in this country. Its servants or officers may live in specific locations. Most of their duties may be carried out there. But their duties can, or may, be carried out anywhere in Canada.
[20]
I think I can take judicial notice that Mr. Kelly has carried out his duties and functions in many different parts of Canada, lately, and successfully, in Toronto.
[21]
I see no inconvenience, in his representing the citizens of Canada in the discovery process of this litigation, to attend in Vancouver where the plaintiffs are headquartered and their counsel carries on business.
Order accordingly.
