NoÃ«l, J.
: This is a s. 18 application brought under rules 310, 321 and 321.1 of the
Federal Court Rules
. The motion is for the issuance of a writ of certiorari and prohibition in respect of the investigation commenced by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (herein the "CHRC") pursuant to a complaint filed by the respondent, Leila Paul, on July 13, 1989, and subsequently amended on September 15, 1989 and October 22, 1990.
Facts
[2]
Leila Paul (herein "Ms. Paul") started temporary employment with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (herein the "CBC") on November 25, 1987. She performed the tasks of a television news reporter and reader, specifically as a weekend anchor on the "Night Final" news program airing on CBUT, Vancouver. In May 1989, Ms. Paul applied for the position of weekday anchor on the same program but was unsuccessful. The position was given to a woman younger than Ms. Paul. Ms. Paul filed a complaint on July 13, 1989 against the CBC: Ms. Paul alleged discrimination on the grounds of sex and age, contrary to s. 7 of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 (herein "the
Act
").
[3]
A position as weekday news anchor for the 6:00 p.m. newscast had become available sometime earlier Although Ms. Paul had not applied for that position, she amended her complaint on September 15, 1989 to include an allegation that CBC discriminated against her when it chose a man for that position in September of 1988.
[4]
The terms and conditions of Ms. Paul's employment with the CBC were governed by the collective agreement in effect between the CBC and the Canadian Union of Public Employees (Office and Professional Unit) (CUPE). On June 9, 1989, a grievance was filed by the union in accordance with art. 56 of the collective agreement It alleged Ms. Paul was not given "equal consideration" for the position on the program "Night Final".
[5]
In July 1989, a further grievance was brought under the collective agreement, requesting that Ms. Paul be given the position of newsreader on "Night Final". No other allegation was made at that time. The two grievances were heard by the joint grievance committee of CUPE and CBC on July 4 and September 19 and 20, 1989 respectively. Both grievances were referred to arbitration pursuant to the collective agreement. On November 16, 1989, CUPE withdrew the grievance initiated by Ms. Paul. The record indicates that at that time, Ms. Paul had found employment with another broadcaster and had no desire to return to the CBC.
[6]
The CBC was first notified of Ms. Paul's complaint by the CHRC on September 27, 1989. Thereafter, documents were produced and interviews of witnesses were scheduled for the end of September 1990. These interviews were cancelled at the last minute when the Human Rights officer was advised by Ms. Paul of her intention to formally raise new allegations of sexual harassment. On October 22, 1990, Ms. Paul amended her complaint to include allegations of discrimination in employment on the grounds of sex against the CBC and one Graham Ritchie, an executive producer, TV News. Specifically, Ms. Paul alleged that the CBC breached s. 7 and s. 14(1) of the
Act
in failing to provide an harassment free workplace. It was also alleged that in March 1989, Mr. Ritchie coerced Ms. Paul into a sexual relationship. A separate complaint was filed against Graham Ritchie on October 29, 1990 alleging discrimination contrary to s. 14(1) of the
Act
.
[7]
The CBC was provided with copy of the amended complaint by letter dated October 25, 1990. By letter dated November 20, 1990, CBC raised a number of concerns about the CHRC's decision to proceed with the investigation of this amended complaint. The CBC argued, inter alia, that the allegation of sexual harassment could not properly form part of an amendment as it raised totally new grounds. It was further argued that as the events giving rise to this allegation had taken place more than one year before the purported amendment, the investigation contemplated was barred by statute.
[8]
In response, the Regional Director of the CHRC, Western Region, acknowledged by letter dated December 5, 1990, that the allegation of sexual harassment could be construed as raising a new ground of complaint, which on the face of it was time barred. On that basis, a decision was made to present the matter to the Commission for a formal determination under s. 41(e) of the
Act
as to whether the complaint should be investigated even though it was filed out of time.
[9]
Submissions were sought and obtained from both Ms. Paul and the CBC on this issue. A "Report Prior to Investigation" was prepared recommending that the Commission proceed with the investigation. By decision dated April 18, 1991, the Commission ruled that the complaint should be dealt with even though it was filed out of time.
[10]
Shortly after being notified of this decision, CBC made an application for:
- the issuance of a writ of prohibition prohibiting the respondent, CHRC, from proceeding with the investigation of the complaint dated July 13, 1989 as purportedly amended on October 22, 1990;
- the issuance of a writ of certiorari quashing the decision of the CHRC to investigate the new complaint against the Third Party, Graham Ritchie, dated October 22, 1990;
- the issuance of a writ of certiorari quashing the CHRC's decision to extend the time limits for the bringing of the complaint of the respondent, Ms. Paul;
- the issuance of writs of certiorari and prohibition in respect of the CHRC's breaches of its duty of procedural fairness in dealing with the complaint submitted by Ms. Paul.
[11]
At the hearing, counsel for the CBC confirmed that the subject matter of his attack is restricted to that part of the decision of the CHRC which authorizes the investigation of the new allegation of sexual harassment raised against the CBC and Graham Ritchie by the complaints dated October 22, 1990 and October 29, 1990.
Analysis
[12]
The factual basis of the CBC's attack on the decision of the CHRC focuses mainly on the actions of the Western Regional Director, Paul Leroux (herein "the Regional Director"), the investigator, Pamela Madsen (herein "the investigator"), and the intake officer, Joan Fromme (herein "the intake officer"), in conjunction with Ms. Paul's complaint. It is alleged that these officers involved themselves in the furtherance of the complaint to the point that they lost the objectivity inherent in their functions This, according to the CBC, led to numerous breaches of the CHRC's duty of procedural fairness, both in the conduct of the investigation and in the purported exercise of the CHRC's discretion to allow the complaint to be investigated even though it was filed out of time.
[13]
The facts raised by the CBC in support of its position are as follows. On June 13, 1989, Ms. Paul filed a written complaint with an intake officer alleging that the CBC had discriminated against her on the basis of age. The investigator was appointed about July 7, 1989. The Regional Director, upon having the complaint submitted to him, suggested that Ms. Paul add the additional ground of sexual discrimination to her complaint. This was not done directly. Rather, the Regional Director, through the investigator, suggested to Ms. Paul that she would not have suffered the same fate had she been a male. Ms. Paul acknowledged that this was the case and the investigator proceeded to draft an addition to Ms. Paul's complaint alleging sexual discrimination. This revised complaint was signed and filed by Ms. Paul on July 13, 1989. The CHRC thereupon "voided" Ms. Paul's original complaint of June 13 1989. The original complaint was never forwarded to the CBC.
[14]
On July 12, 1989, Ms. Paul decided to add allegations of discrimination with respect to a prior position which had been filled by a man in September of 1988. In the light of this, the CHRC withheld communication of the complaint signed on July 13, 1989, and the investigator proceeded to draft amendments setting forth this further ground. The amended version was approved by the Regional Director. Some two months later, the complaint was forwarded to the president of CBC under cover of a letter signed by the Regional Director announcing the CHRC's decision to investigate the matter. The top portion of the complaint form reflected the following typewritten statement: "THIS AMENDS THE COMPLAINT FORM ORIGINALLY SIGNED JULY 13, 1989".
[15]
On June 25, 1990, the investigator wrote the CBC requesting specified documentation and interviews with four CBC employees. The requested documentation was provided under cover of two letters dated September 7 and 13, 1990, which also outlined CBC's general response to the complaint. Interviews had been scheduled to take place in Vancouver on September 25, 26 and 27, 1990.
[16]
The day before the interviews were scheduled to begin, the investigator had a number of telephone conversations with Ms. Paul. During the first conversation, the investigator revealed to Ms. Paul in "some detail" the response of the CBC as outlined in the CBC letters of September 7 and 13, 1990. It is upon being apprised of the CBC response to her complaint that Ms. Paul first mentioned what the investigator noted as "the real reason for the refusal of the position". Ms. Paul indicated that she had been the victim of sexual harassment. She alleged that on March 13, 1989, the executive producer, Graham Ritchie, after a party, physically coerced her into having a sexual relation. She further alleged that Graham Ritchie subsequently sought to have sexual relation with her on four or five occasions and that she reluctantly agreed on two of these occasions. She alleged that the fear of the loss of her employment compelled her to respond to Ritchie's requests. This relationship with Ritchie was allegedly ended by Ms. Paul on or around April 30, 1989.
[17]
Immediately after this conversation, the investigator sought advice by phone from the Regional Director. The investigator took extensive notes of the advice she received and I will come back to these later. In the course of a second telephone conversation taking place subsequently on the same day, Ms. Paul confirmed to the investigator her decision to proceed with the new allegation. Thereupon the investigator informed the CBC that the interviews scheduled to commence the next day would not proceed in light of the new allegations raised by Ms. Paul.
[18]
In the weeks following, a new complaint was drafted by the investigator incorporating into the complaint of July 13, 1989 as amended on September 15, 1989, the allegation of sexual harassment and the breach of s. 14(1) of the
Act
. This last complaint was signed on October 22, 1990. The top portion of this last complaint form read: "THIS AMENDS THE COMPLAINT FORM ORIGINALLY SIGNED JULY 13, 1989, AND AMENDED ON SEPTEMBER 15, 1990". By letter dated October 25, 1990, the CHRC provided the CBC with copy of the twice amended complaint and communicated its decision to investigate the complaint as amended.
[19]
By letter dated November 30, 1990, the CBC, by its solicitors, advised the Regional Director that the allegation of sexual harassment and the related breach of s. 14(1) of the
Act
raised wholly new grounds which were time-barred. The letter concluded:
"Before we proceed any further with any complaint by Leila Paul and in light of the above, the Corporation insists on a formal decision by the Human Rights Commission:
(a) considering the untimely nature of the complaint and ruling on it.
(b) considering the nature of the so-called 'amendment' to this complaint and ruling on its propriety, particularly in light of the unfairness of such proceedings against both the corporation and third parties."
[20]
By letter dated December 5, 1990, the Regional Director replied, inter alia, as follows:
"I very much understand your concerns regarding the rather unusual amendment of this complaint and I will address them in the following paragraphs.
1.
The issue of timeliness
. You are correct in stating that Leila Paul amended her complaint form on October 22, 1990 to add an allegation of sexual harassment which is over a year old. Since it is your position that this constitutes not so much an amendment but an entirely new allegation which requires a decision of the Commission before proceeding, I have decided to present this case to the Commission. A report will be disclosed to you in due course and you will have an opportunity to make a submission directly to the Commission.
2.
The nature of the complaint
. It is true that the new allegation is totally different from the previous ones but not necessarily contradictory as more than one prohibited grounds could be factors in an employment decision."
[21]
Subsequently, a "Report Prior to Investigation" was drafted setting forth, for the benefit of the Commission, the recommendation of the investigative staff on the issue of the timeliness of the new allegation. The summarized report reads as follows:
"Summary of complaint/RÃ©sumÃ© de la plainte
"The complainant originally filed a complaint alleging age and sex discrimination on July 13, 1989, with an amendment on September 15, 1989, alleging that she had been denied a news anchor position because of her age and sex. During investigation, she made a further allegation that she had been sexually harassed, which had not been mentioned before.
"The respondent takes the position that the new allegation is out of time and that it constitutes an abuse of process. The allegation was filed some 17 months after the alleged incidents.
"Summary of reason for recommendation/Justification de la recommandation
1. The allegation of harassment are linked to the original complaint as the complainant is now alleging that her refusal to continue sexual encounters with her supervisor was an additional factor in the employment decisions.
2. The length of the delay is not likely to prejudice the respondent. The complainant states that she was originally reluctant to include the allegation of sexual harassment because of the implications of publicity and embarrassment to her family. Upon questioning by the investigator on the original issues, she felt she had to come forward with the allegations.
"Recommendation/Recommandation
"It is recommended that the Commission deal with the amended complaint even though the acts complained of occurred more than one year before the amendment was received."
(In these reasons, the word "Commission" refers to the Chief Commissioner, the Deputy Chief Commissioner and the members as defined in s. 26 of the
Act
. The term Canadian Human Rights Commission ("CHRC") refers to the Commission as a whole, including the officers and staff.)
[22]
By letter dated January 25, 1991, the Regional Director provided the CBC and Ms. Paul with a copy of the report and invited both parties to provide comments and submissions on the issue of the timeliness of the new allegations. The CBC responded on February 11, 1991, and Ms. Paul presented her submissions by letter dated March 11, 1991.
[23]
These letters together with the above-noted report were submitted to the Commission for a decision under s. 41(e) of the
Act
. On April 18, 1991, the Commission ruled as follows:
"The Commission has decided to exercise its discretionary power to extend the time limit within which the complaints may be filed. The Commission has therefore decided, pursuant to para. 41(e) of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
, to deal with the complaints even though the acts complained of occurred more than one year before the receipt of the complaints by the Commission."
(The complaint against the third party, Graham Ritchie, was also referred to the Commission at the same time for a s. 41(e) determination on the basis of the same material.)
[24]
No additional reasons were provided by the Commission in reaching its decision.
[25]
Section 41(e) reads as follows:
"41. Subject to s. 40, the Commission shall deal with any complaint filed with it unless in respect of that complaint it appears to the commission that
. . . . .
(e) the complaint is based on acts or omissions the last of which occurred more than one year, or such longer period of time as the Commission considers appropriate in the circumstances, before receipt of the complaint."
[26]
This provision has been construed by this court as giving the Commission the discretion to deal with a complaint based on facts occurring more than one year before its filing. Conversely, this court has held that the Commission does not have the jurisdiction to deal with a time-barred complaint unless it first exercises its discretion to do so under s. 41(e) (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at p. 64). All the parties proceeded on the basis that s. 41(e) should be so construed.
[27]
It is clear, in the case at hand, that the allegation of sexual harassment raised new and different grounds from those previously advanced, and that the factual foundation for the allegation rested on events which had occurred some 17 months prior to the allegation being made. This is not disputed by the CHRC. That being so, the CHRC could not initiate an investigation into these new grounds, without first exercising its discretion under s. 41(e) of the
Act
.
[28]
The Regional Director did acknowledge this, but only after the CBC brought the matter to his attention on November 30, 1990. The evidence indicates that up to that point in time, the Regional Director and the investigator were of the view that the new allegations could be treated as a mere amendment.
[29]
As indicated earlier, the investigator took extensive notes of the numerous telephone conversations which she had on September 24, 1990, the day when she was confronted with Ms. Paul's new allegations of sexual harassment. Her notes indicate that she spoke to the Regional Director to explain the situation and obtain advice. She was advised by the Regional Director that Ms. Paul, before going forth with her new allegations, should be clearly informed on several points, including the following:
(3) Tribunal or Judicial Review - if the case goes beyond the Commission's administrative decision, it becomes public knowledge. Is she willing to deal with the publicity of a sexual harassment case?
(4) Investigation process - if she doesn't add the allegations now, they cannot be dealt with in this investigation. If she wanted to bring up the allegations at a later point, the Commission may or may not choose to deal with them. If she leaves them until disclosure or at the end of the investigation, could be seen as being made in bad faith. The CBC may object to dealing with such allegations at that time - may force matter to tribunal.
[30]
The investigator's notes confirm that she thereafter spoke to Ms. Paul and discussed all of the points raised by the Regional Director. Ms. Paul immediately informed the investigator of her decision to go forth, and the notes conclude: "I (i.e. the investigator) said I would amend complaint form, send it to her a.s.a.p.".
[31]
It is clear from the foregoing that, at the relevant time, the Regional Director was of the view that the additional complaint could be dealt with as a mere amendment if proceeded with quickly. This is surprising as the allegation was then at least five months out of time. Having regard to drastic implications associated with the public disclosure of Ms. Paul's sexual encounters with Mr. Ritchie, Ms. Paul should have been advised that her new complaint was time-barred and could only be investigated if the Commission decided to do so after considering all the relevant facts.
[32]
In this respect, I note that the Regional Director, in his letter of December 5, 1990 to the CBC wherein he acceded to the request for a formal review, stated that before Ms. Paul decided to come forth:
"We pointed out to the complainant the seriousness of the allegation
and the timeliness issue
." (Underlining is mine)
[33]
The evidence suggests otherwise. Ms. Paul was not told that her new allegation was, on the fact of it, out of time and would require a formal decision by the Commission before it could be proceeded with. On the contrary, the clear impression left from the investigator's notes is that she was told that the new allegation would be investigated if she added it "now".
[34]
Be that as it may, the Regional Director could not have been overly surprised when, soon after the amended complaint was served on the CBC, he was confronted with a request by the CBC for a formal ruling under s. 41(e) of the
Act
as to whether the new complaint should be dealt with by the Commission.
[35]
The Regional Director, after having taken the position that the new allegation, if made without further delay, would be investigated and after having invited Ms. Paul to proceed on that basis, was placed in a delicate position by CBC's request for a formal decision as to whether the time-barred complaint should be investigated.
[36]
On or around December 5, 1990, the Regional Director took it upon himself to initiate the s. 41(e) review process. The intake officer was asked to prepare what is called a "Prior to Investigation Report". The purpose of the report was to outline for the benefit of the Commission the facts relevant to the exercise of its discretion and the staff recommendation. The investigator assembled the documentary evidence to be sent to the Commission in conjunction with the report. The report was signed by the intake officer and by the Regional Director on December 14, 1990. It recommended that the complaint be investigated. As noted earlier, the Commission adopted the recommendation embodied in the report and ordered that the allegation be investigated.
[37]
Turning to the report on which the decision was based, the only acknowledgement of any fact which could have militated against the investigation of the time-barred complaint is dealt with and disposed of in the assertion that "the length of the delay is not likely to prejudice the respondent". Otherwise, the allegation of sexual harassment is presented as being "linked to the original complaint" which was "initially filed within the one year time limit" and is presented as "an additional factor in the employment decisions". These statements are offered as reasons supporting the recommendation that the complaint be investigated.
[38]
I stop here and point out that the reason why the allegation of sexual harassment requires that the Commission exercise its discretion under s. 41(e) before it can be proceeded with is that Ms. Paul decided not to make the allegation in the first place. That being so, the fact that she had made a complaint on different grounds within the one year time limit cannot be of high relevance. The same reasoning applies to the statement that sexual harassment was "linked" to the original complaint and was an "additional factor" in the employment decisions. Obviously, a wholly new allegation, even though alleged by reference to employment decisions already under attack, cannot be saved because it is "linked" or that it "adds" to a prior complaint. Whatever sympathy one may have had for Ms. Paul's belated complaint, the only facts of relevance to the exercise of the Commission's discretion were those which supported as well as those which undermined Ms. Paul's reasons for not coming forth with the allegation in question earlier.
[39]
Attached to the summary report is a long form report which reproduces the allegations supporting Ms. Paul's complaint in the course of 19 paragraphs, followed by a paragraph on the issue of the jurisdiction, and by a section headed
DISCUSSION
. The paragraphs under that heading reflect essentially what is stated in the summary report. They state:
"21. In the exercise of its discretion to deal with this complaint, the Commission may wish to consider the following:
"22. The amended complaint form was signed October 22, 1990, approximately 17 months after the alleged discriminatory act occurred.
"23. The complaint was initially filed within the one year time frame for filing a complaint; however, because of the nature of the further allegations of sexual harassment, the complainant was reluctant to include these allegations in her original complaint form.
"24. The complainant states that she was originally reluctant to include the allegation of sexual harassment because of the implications of publicity and embarrassment to her family. Upon questioning by the investigator on the original issues, she felt she had to come forward with the allegations.
"25. The length of the delay is not likely to prejudice the respondent."
[40]
The recommendation to proceed with the investigation then follows.
[41]
A number of relevant facts were omitted from the report. For instance, the investigator had been made aware by the CBC letter of September 7, 1990, that Ms. Paul had submitted her resignation on March 7, 1989 to be effective April 16, 1989. The intake officer was also aware of Ms. Paul's decision to leave the CBC as of the "second week of March" 1989. The CBC had also pointed out that Ms. Paul had rescinded her resignation sometime prior to April 16. As the first instance of sexual harassment alleged by Ms. Paul occurred on April 13, 1989, and as Ms. Paul's allegation included one that she agreed to have sex with Mr. Ritchie in order to keep her job, the resignation appeared most relevant. Yet, the investigator, upon being cross-examined on her affidavit, indicated that she did not attempt to determine whether Ms. Paul had effectively withdrawn her resignation at the relevant time, and no mention is made of the resignation in the report.
[42]
As to Ms. Paul's reasons for not coming forth with the allegation of sexual harassment earlier and, in particular, the embarrassment which would result from the disclosure, the evidence indicates that the investigator was aware that Ms. Paul had previously discussed the events underlying this allegation with Kathryn Wedge, the lawyer who had acted for the union in the context of her grievance, as well as her assistant. Had the investigator asked Ms. Paul whether these events were disclosed to others, she would have been informed that, before September 24, 1990, Ms. Paul had also disclosed and discussed these events with Mr. McMullen and Ms. Maitland, fellow employees from the CBC, as well as with another fellow employee from BCTV.
[43]
These facts, while not determinative of the question which the Commission was called upon to decide, were relevant to the exercise of its discretion. When the investigator was asked during cross-examination why the resignation was not alluded to in the report, she replied that as a matter of practice, the report only reflects the allegations made in support of the complaint. I can understand why this should be the case when a report is prepared before an investigation has begun, and the officers are aware of no other facts. But here, the investigation was in process, and there can be no excuse for omitting from the report facts relevant to the exercise of the Commission's discretion.
[44]
Finally, I note that at the time the Commission rendered its decision, it had before it not only the report but also the written representations of both Ms. Paul and the CBC. One would expect that the CBC, in its representations, would have dealt with the shortcomings of the report. It did so to a limited extent and I must say, with hindsight, that the shortcomings of the report could have been addressed more forcefully. However, at the time, the CBC was unaware of the involvement of the Regional Director and the investigator in inviting Ms. Paul to proceed with her late filed complaint notwithstanding the requirements of s. 41(e). Indeed, it had been misled into believing that Ms. Paul had decided to proceed only after being told that her new complaint was time-barred. While the CBC expressed astonishment with respect to the recommendation embodied in the report, it was not in a position to point out, for the benefit of the Commission, its lack of objectivity.
Decision
[45]
The Commission, when saddled with the task of deciding whether a time-barred complaint should be investigated, must deal with two diverging interests. On the one hand, the author of the complaint should, upon advancing reasons which make the delay excusable in the eyes of the Commission, have the right to see the complaint investigated. On the other hand, the person targeted by the complaint has a prima facie right not to be confronted with allegations relating to long past events. Muldoon, J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , stated at p. 64:
"Now, it is apparent that Parliament in setting the datum-line criterion of one year's limit in para. 41(e) did so in order seriously to confer a benefit and not just wantonly to complicate the C.H.R.A. That one year's limit appears to be of no direct benefit to the complainant. Whom did Parliament intend to benefit? The limit - permeable as it is in terms of the commission's consideration of what is appropriate - appears to be of direct benefit to a respondent employer, such as S.O.S. in this case. It is just too plain for elaboration that if the employer is to be deprived of the benefit which Parliament provided, the commission must give some cogent signal or demonstration of why it considered it to be appropriate so to deprive the employer."
[46]
It follows that the Commission, in exercising its discretion under s. 41(e), owes a duty of fairness to those potentially affected by its decision which means, at the very least, that the matter must be dealt with objectively and without bias.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 271; 301 A.P.R. 271, at p. 638, Cory, J., wrote for the court:
"It can be seen that there is a great diversity of administrative boards. Those that are primarily adjudicative in their function will be expected to comply with the standard applicable to courts. That is to say that the conduct of the members of the board should be such that there could be no reasonable apprehension of bias with regard to their decision. At the other end of the scale are boards with popularly elected members such as those dealing with planning and development whose members are municipal councillors. With those boards, the standard will be much more lenient. In order to disqualify the members a challenging party must establish that there has been a prejudgment of the matter to such an extent that any representations to the contrary would be futile. Administrative boards that deal with matters of policy will be closely comparable to the boards composed of municipal councillors. For those boards, a strict application of a reasonable apprehension of bias as a test might undermine the very role which has been entrusted to them by the legislature."
[47]
The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal adopted this last statement in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Admin. L.R.(2d) 1 (C.A.), where it stated, at p. 14:
"The commission owes a duty of fairness to all persons whose actions it must investigate. The extent of that duty is determined by and dependent on the nature and the function of the tribunal. Fairness cannot exist if the adjudicator is biased. The test to determine whether there is bias or fairness is whether a reasonably informed bystander could reasonably perceive bias (see
Committee for  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (...)). The extent of the duty of fairness ranges from administrative tribunals such as the National Energy Board where the prior business activities of a member of the board were considered and measured against the standard of public confidence to determine the impartiality of the board, to a municipal council where the standard is the 'open-mindedness' of a member of council notwithstanding previous statements in which the councillor had clearly and unequivocally stated a position for or against an issue (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (...)). Thus where the board is performing an adjudicative function, the standard is that which is applicable to the courts, that is, there should be no reasonable apprehension of bias. Where the function is investigative, the standard is open-mindedness, that is the issue has not been predetermined."
[48]
The test, therefore, is not whether bias can reasonably be apprehended, but whether, as a matter of fact, the standard of open-mindedness has been lost to the point where it can reasonably be said that the issue before the investigative body has been predetermined.
[49]
In this instance, it is clear that both the Regional Director and the investigator predetermined the question as to whether the complaint should be dealt with even though it was filed out of time. Indeed, the investigator, on instructions from the Regional Director, advised Ms. Paul that her complaint would be dealt with if she proceeded quickly, without mentioning to her that her new complaint was late under the terms of the
Act
.
[50]
Ms. Paul did proceed quickly and raised the new complaint. The CHRC immediately communicated the amended complaint to the CBC and announced that it would be investigated. The Regional Director was then confronted with a request for a formal decision by the Commission. A report was then prepared highlighting the staff recommendation for the benefit of the Commission.
[51]
Both the Regional Director and the investigator participated in the preparation of the report. Its failings have been previously identified. It is clear to me that the Regional Director and the investigator had set minds as to the recommendation which was to be embodied in the report. They had predetermined the issue and invited Ms. Paul to go forth on that basis. Ms. Paul did so at some apparent cost to her private life and both the Regional Director and the investigator were aware of the repercussions for Ms. Paul. Against this background, it is clear that the officers, after having advised Ms. Paul that her complaint would be investigated, lost the objectivity inherent in their function which was to make a fair and unbiased representation on the issue of timeliness for the benefit of the Commission.
[52]
The Commission adopted the recommendation embodied in the report. It gave no reasons. It adopted the report on the obvious assumption that it reflected a fair and unbiased presentation of all the relevant facts. While the objectivity of the members of the Commission is not in issue, it seems clear that, by adopting the flawed report, the Commission rendered a decision without the benefit of the relevant facts.
[53]
In
Syndicat des employÃ©s de production du QuÃ©bec et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court of Canada held that, where the Commission renders a decision without reasons, by simply adopting the conclusions embodied in an investigator's report, the report can be looked upon as evidencing the reasons for the decision. Sopinka, J., stated, for the majority, at pp. 902-903:
"It is submitted that failure to give reasons is itself a basis for review. Assuming without deciding that this is so in the absence of a statutory requirement to give reasons (...) in my opinion there is no basis for such review in this case. The appellant was notified that the Commission had decided that the positions which were the subject of comparison did not constitute work of equal value. The basis for this conclusion was the very extensive report of the investigator which the Commission adopted. This, the Commission was entitled by statute to do. The report which it adopted was in the hands of the appellant. Accordingly, the later was fully apprised of the reasons for the Commission's decision. There is, therefore, no ground for suggesting that there was any denial of natural justice or procedural fairness in this regard."

The report in issue here, although not strictly speaking an investigation report within the meaning of s. 44, because compiled at the preliminary stage, is the basis upon which the Commission exercised its statutory jurisdiction to deal with the belated complaint. If the report which it adopted in making its decision is flawed, it must follow that the decision itself is equally flawed. For these reasons, I believe the decision must be quashed.
[55]
There remains the question of further remedies. I note that Ms. Paul is not responsible for the manner in which her late filed complaint was handled. She is entitled by law to have the Commission examine all the circumstances surrounding her late filed claim and determined whether it ought to be investigated. Equally, the CBC and the third party have a right not to be confronted with time-barred complaint unless the Commission exercises its discretion to do so. In these circumstances, I will order that the Commission decide again the question as to whether the time-barred complaint should be investigated on the basis of all relevant facts including those which may be reflected in a staff report prepared by officers other than those involved in the report underlying the decision hereby quashed.
Order accordingly.
