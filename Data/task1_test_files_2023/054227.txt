Reed, J.
: The plaintiff alleges that the defendant has infringed Canadian letters patent number 853,397. That patent issued on October 5, 1970; it is owned by the plaintiff; the inventors are stated to be Messrs. Kerwin, Klein and Sarace. The main issues in this case are: (1) whether the patent can be infringed by a process which uses a technology essentially developed after the date of the invention; (2) whether that patent is valid. There are, in addition, the usual collection of attacks made on the patent on the grounds of anticipation, ambiguity, insufficient disclosure, obviousness and that the claims are broader than the invention made.
I
Mosfets
[2]
The patent relates to a method for making what are called metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (Mosfets). These form part of the integrated circuit arrays which are used in computers, calculators and other types of electronic equipment. A Mosfet can be depicted in a stylized graphic form as set out below:
[Diagram omitted. See printed version.]
[3]
When a voltage is applied to the gate electrode an electric field is created. As a result, a channel is opened close to the surface of the substrate below the gate insulator and a current is induced to flow between the source and drain, through that channel. A device in which the channel is opened by application of voltage to the gate is called an enhancement mode device. Conversely, if the channel is open when there is no voltage on the gate, the device is called a depletion mode device. In a depletion mode device, the channel is closed by the application of voltage to the gate.
[4]
The substrate is made of silicon, to which minute quantities of an impurity have been added. Depending upon what kinds of impurities are added the silicon will have either a positive or negative type conductivity; that is, it will be called either P-type silicon or N-type silicon. A number of different elements can be used as impurities for this purpose, providing they are from the appropriate group of the Periodic Table. It suffices for the purposes of these reasons to note, as examples, that the addition of boron will result in a P-type silicon and the addition of phosphorous will result in an N-type silicon.
[5]
The well regions of the source and drain must have the opposite type conductivity to the substrate. Thus a P-type substrate will be treated ("doped") in the well regions to give those regions an N-type conductivity. Conversely a transistor made in an N-type substrate will have the well regions doped to give those regions a P-type conductivity. If the source and drain wells are of an N-type conductivity the device ultimately fabricated will be an N-channel device. If the source and drain are of P-type conductivity the device will be called a P-channel device.
[6]
In the mid-1960s, the main method of creating the source and drain wells in the substrate was by a process called vapour deposition. Vapour deposition involves exposing the surface of the substrate of the source and drain regions to a gas containing the impurity with which it is wished to dope the source and drain. Other methods of introducing the impurities also existed: a spin on technique, a paint on technique and direct metal diffusion. It is my understanding that all of these involved exposing the surface of the substrate to the impurities so that as a first step they would "soak" into the substrate at the top of the source and drain regions.
[7]
For the purpose of these reasons I will refer to the fabrication of an N-channel device and will assume that the impurity ("dopant") to be added to the well areas is phosphorous. In such a case, vapour deposition would involve exposing the surface of the substrate above what will eventually become the source and drain well regions to a gas which contains phosphorous. The phosphorous is thereby deposited in a thin film on the surface and becomes absorbed into the substrate, close to the surface, in those areas. Not only must the phosphorous be absorbed in a physical sense into the substrate, however, it must also take up a certain positional relationship within the molecular structure (lattice) of the silicon. The phosphorous atoms must replace or be substituted for some of the silicon atoms. This is accomplished by heating the silicon which has been exposed to the phosphorous to a very high temperature for an extended period of time, for example, at 1,000 [degrees] C for one hour.
[8]
The initial process of exposing the silicon to the phosphorous gas is referred to in the evidence as the "predep" or "predeposition" step. The second process, that of exposing it to a very high temperature for a required period of time, is referred to as the "drive-in" step. The "drive-in" step not only moves the impurity atoms into the appropriate positions in the silicon lattice, it also results in the doped well regions becoming deeper and broader than they were before. It is my understanding that in the early days, vapour deposition involved only one step and that was simply the exposing of the silicon substrate to the phosphorous gas at a high temperature for an extended period of time.
[9]
While I have said that only the source and drain areas of the surface of the substrate are exposed to the phosphorous gas, in fact the whole device is so exposed as are all other devices which are being fabricated on the same silicon wafer. The areas which one does not want to be affected by the phosphorous gas, however, are protected from the gas by a mask. The mask is created by first coating the whole surface with a photosensitive material called a photo resist. The photo resist is then exposed to light in a pattern which is itself determined by a template. The pattern of the template allows only some areas of the photo resist to be exposed to the light. When developed, those areas of the photo resist which have been exposed to light form a hard material which ultimately protects the area underneath from exposure to the phosphorous. Before exposure of the source and drain regions to the phosphorous gas can take place, however, the unexposed photo resist which still covers those areas must be removed. This is done by placing the wafer in an etchant. The substance chosen as an etchant will be one which dissolves the unexposed photo resist but not the exposed mask. It also must not dissolve the silicon substrate. This is an oversimplified description of what I understand the total process to have been but for the purpose of these reasons it illustrates that process sufficiently.
[10]
The fabrication of integrated circuits of which the transistors are a part involves a series of steps of photolithographic masking, etching and depositing various substances in order to form the layers in the required pattern within and on the silicon wafer. As noted, it is not necessary to refer to these in detail. It is sufficient to state that a mask acts as a stencil allowing the creation of areas of different conductivity and layers of different material to be arranged in the required pattern.
[11]
The transistors which are being fabricated are very small. Some idea of the size involved can be gleaned from the diagram below:
[Diagram omitted. See printed version.]
Another perspective on the size of the devices can be obtained by reference to the size of the gate length. The gate length is the distance between the source and the drain. In 1965-66, this distance was around 10 to 25 microns. A micron is one millionth of a metre. Today transistors can be made with gate lengths of less than one micron.
[12]
In 1965-66 the number of transistors typically incorporated into an integrated circuit usually numbered a few hundred (under 500). Today the components of an integrated circuit can number one million. In the mid-1960's silicon wafers had diameters of 1" to 2" and might contain 50 to 200 identical but separate integrated circuits (chips). Today the wafers can be made with diameters of 6" to 8" and several hundred integrated circuits (chips) can be made from one silicon wafer.
[13]
All the diagrams of the Mosfets contained in the evidence as well as those set out above are not to scale. The vertical dimensions have been grossly over exaggerated. The actual devices are so thin that had the diagrams been to scale nothing useful would be seen. The gate length is actually 200 to 250 times the thickness of the insulating layer.
[14]
What is in issue in this case is the fabrication of a transistor. However, when transistors are fabricated as part of an integrated circuit, as they typically are, all the components of the circuit are fabricated together on the silicon wafer. A circuit may be composed of a complex array of components consisting of many transistors, diodes, resistors and capacitors. As noted, these are all made in and of the silicon. In order to operate, the various components must all be interconnected in the arrangement called for by the particular circuit. Conceptually one can think of the components of the circuit being "wired" together. In fact the interconnection is made by a process called metallization. Metal is deposited over the whole surface and then etched from the areas where it is not wanted.
[15]
In the mid-1960's, at the time the developments to which the patent relate occurred, the gate electrodes of Mosfets were made out of metal, usually aluminum. Indeed, as I understand it, the creation of the gate electrode and the metallization of the device could occur at the same time. Aluminum and the other metals which were used for gate electrodes degrade or evaporate at the high temperatures required for the "drive-in" step of the doping process. Thus the fabricating sequence used was one whereby the source and drain wells in the substrate were created first, for example by the vapour deposition method. Then the gate insulator and gate electrode were deposited on top. This required a very careful alignment of the gate over the source and drain regions.
[16]
If the gate was badly misaligned with respect to the source and drain the transistor would not work at all. To prevent misalignment it was common to allow for overlap tolerances which were greater than required for the optimum operation of the device. The larger the overlap the greater was an undesirable effect known as parasitic or Miller capacitance. Ideally it was desirable for the overlap on each side of the gate to be as small as possible and to be equal on both sides. A smaller gate would allow more devices to be placed onto the same chip and it would allow for greater speed in the operation of the device.
[17]
The fabrication processes in existence in the mid-60's gave a yield of about 10 functional chips out of every 100 potential chips which existed at the start of the fabrication process. This low yield in the fabrication process was caused by a number of factors. One was the misalignments caused by the critical masking and alignment requirements in placing the gate over the source and drain.

AT&T Work And The Patent
[18]
In February of 1966, Messrs. Kerwin, Klein and Sarace together with others met in a conference room at Bell Telephone Laboratories, now AT&T Bell Telephone Laboratory, for the purpose of discussing the fabrication of Mosfets. Out of that meeting came the idea of using silicon as the gate electrode material and "building the transistor backwards". Silicon can withstand the high temperatures required in the doping process and thus could be put in place before the doping step to form the source and drain was undertaken. The silicon to be used for the gate electrode would necessarily be a polycrystalline silicon because of the manner in which it would be deposited. The silicon substrate is monocrystalline silicon; that is, the crystal lattice is uniform and continuous. Polycrystalline silicon, on the other hand, is formed as an aggregate. This can be thought of as chunks of silicon pressed together with the lattice of each chunk not necessarily being aligned with that of the adjacent chunk. Polycrystalline silicon would therefore be discontinuous in comparison to monocrystalline silicon. It would be more difficult to make a layer composed of such crystals uniformly conductive. Polycrystalline silicon is sometimes referred to as "polysilicon" and sometimes as "poly".
[19]
Dr. Klein sketched out the fabrication sequence, which was agreed upon at the February 1966 meeting, in a series of diagrams which can be summarized as follows: deposit a layer of silicon nitride (ultimately to be the gate insulator); deposit a layer of silicon dioxide (called the field oxide which separates the electrodes that will ultimately be attached to a finished device from the surface); mask and etch down to the silicon nitride layer to create a window where the source, drain and gate will go; deposit a layer of polysilicon; mask and etch so as to remove the polysilicon except over the gate region; using the polysilicon as a mask, etch through the silicon nitride so as to bare the surface of the substrate in the source and drain regions; diffuse (or possibly use low temperature diffusion ion implantation); remove glass (which is created on the surface by the diffusion process); evaporate platinum and heat to form platinum silicide (used to increase the conductivity of the polysilicon gate if necessary and seen as a part of the interconnection step); perform interconnection metallization.
[20]
At that time Bell Labs was working with silicon nitride as the gate insulator. Bell was not fabricating devices for commercial purposes. The work being done was largely experimental in nature.
[21]
Consequent on the February 1966 meeting, various members of the research staff at Bell Labs were assigned tasks related to the fabrication of transistors in accordance with the fabrication sequence which had been agreed upon. This culminated in a working device being fabricated by May 31, 1966. It was tested using what is called a "curve tracer". This oscilloscope allows one to determine the amount of current which flows from the source to the drain as different voltage levels are applied to the gate. The testing established that the device exhibited the characteristics of a transistor. The last two steps in the February 1966 fabrication sequence (the evaporation of platinum and the metallization) were not carried out because the transistor was being made and tested as a stand alone device for experimental purposes and not as part of an integrated circuit.
[22]
Upon the successful testing of the device Dr. Kerwin, at Dr. Klein's behest, made an entry in his laboratory notebook describing what had been done and the results obtained. This entry is dated May 31, 1966. The last entries with respect to the process state: "heat to form silicide & then metallize to form interconnections by standard procedures" and "first result: very promising. Few shorts evident. Tested prior to platinization".
[23]
Initial discussions respecting the filing of a patent for the process conceived at the February 1966 meeting took place in mid-September 1966. These were followed by a memorandum describing the process. It reads in part as follows:
"A critical requirement in fabricating an Fet structure is that the gate electrode must overlap the drain and source junctions. Ordinary processing techniques usually generate the source and drain junctions and then attempt to affix the gate to meet the overlap requirement. One of the key features of the new process is that the gate serves to define the source and drain areas such that subsequent diffusion, which generates the junctions, is constrained to result in the correct overlap. Because conventional diffusion processes require temperatures in the order of 1,000 [degrees] C metals cannot be used for the gate electrode in this application. It is for this reason that a polycrystalline silicon film is used as the gate electrode. In addition to serving as a mask, the silicon film is rendered conductive during the diffusion step and thus serves as the electrical contact for the gate.
. . . . .
"In Sept. 8, silicon nitride is removed from the source and drain areas. The hot phosphoric acid used to remove the exposed nitride films does not attack any or the other layers. The source and drain junctions are formed by a gaseous diffusion into the single crystal areas. At the same time the polycrystalline silicon films over the gate and pad regions are sufficiently doped to become highly conductive. The silicon film over the gate can then serve as the gate electrode and requires no subsequent metallization. Contact between devices is obtained by standard metallization, resulting in the desired Fet arrays.
"In summary, the distinctive features of the process are:
1. A method of fabricating field effect transistors with high yield using
self-limiting
etching systems to selectively etch a multilayer structure by batch processing techniques has been developed.
2. The use of polycrystalline silicon to provide a self-aligned gate structure in the Fet has been demonstrated." (Exhibit P-7-2)
[24]
As noted above, the material which had been chosen for use as a gate insulator was silicon nitride. Silicon nitride proved to be impractical as a gate insulator. By mid-November 1966, the problems with silicon nitride were solved by adopting a two-layer gate insulator: one layer made of silicon nitride and a second layer made of silicon dioxide. The mid-September 1966 memorandum respecting the patenting of the invention was subsequently followed, on January 5, 1967, by another memorandum describing the silicon nitride/silicon dioxide sandwich structure for the gate insulator:
"Since my letter of November 15, we have modified the new fabrication procedure of M.I.S. transistors to incorporate a sandwich insulation structure in the gate region. The gate insulator now consists of 600A of SiO[2] and 400 A of Si[3]N[4]. (c.f. att.) This modification has improved the electrical characteristics of the gate by lowering the threshold voltage and improving its stability. The particular materials mentioned above are exemplary of a class of composite insulators which could be employed in this manner." (Exhibit P-7-3)
The patent application was filed in Canada on February 6, 1968. It issued on October 6, 1970, claiming a priority date of March 27, 1967 on the basis of its U.S. filing.
III
Construction Of The Patent
[25]
I will now turn to the construction of the patent. The claims in issue are claims 1, 9 and 10:
"1. In the method for making a semiconductor structure in which a diffused region of one conductivity type is formed in a semiconductor substrate having the opposite conductivity type and which requires an insulating layer and an overlying conductive layer have a critical spatial relationship with respect to the diffused region the improvement which comprises forming the insulating layer on the semiconductor substrate, forming a silicon layer over selected portions of the insulating layer, etching away the exposed portions of the insulating layer, using the silicon layer as a mask, diffusing impurities into the semiconductor substrate to form the diffusion layer using the silicon layer as a diffusion mask and simultaneously or separately diffusing impurities into the silicon layer to render it conductive.
. . . . .
"9. In an insulated-gate silicon field effect transistor, the improvement which comprises a gate electrode which is of polycrystalline silicon.
"10. The transistor of claim 9 in which the gate insulator comprises silicon dioxide."
[26]
There is no dispute as to the applicable law. The construction of the patent is a question for the court; that construction is to proceed on the basis that the addressee of the patent is a person skilled in the art, having the knowledge that such a person is likely to possess. In the context of this patent such a person is one skilled in metal oxide semiconductor technology. The patent must be construed by a mind willing to understand, seeking a construction which is reasonable and fair to both patentee and the public. (These principles can be found in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at p. 466 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  claims are the starting point. The claims alone define the statutory monopoly and the patentee has a statutory duty to state in the claims what the invention is that it is desired to protect. In construing the claims recourse to the rest of the specification is: (1) permissible to assist in understanding the terms used in the claims; (2) unnecessary where the words of the claim are plain and unambiguous; and (3) improper to vary the scope or ambit of the claims. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 1 (F.C.A.).)
[28]
Applying those principles to the claims in issue, I conclude that the invention claimed in the claims teaches:
(1) using polysilicon as the gate electrode material;
(2) using the gate as a mask to form the self-aligned source and drain; and
(3) doping the polysilicon to make it sufficiently conductive so as to operate as the gate electrode.
[29]
It was argued by counsel for the plaintiff that an expanded version of this construction should be placed upon the patent. Specifically it was suggested that in addition the patent teaches that (1) no further processing of the polysilicon layer of the gate is needed after the doping of the source and drain, to make the polysilicon layer of the gate sufficiently conductive to operate as a gate electrode; and (2) the interconnection or metallization of the device takes place away from the gate region.
[30]
It is argued that these conclusions should be drawn from the evidence because: claim 9 teaches that the gate electrode is to be polycrystalline silicon and nothing more; in order to determine what the invention is one looks at both the claims and the disclosure and when this is done the only purpose of rendering the gate conductive can be to make it into the gate electrode (the conductive layer); some witnesses particularly, Dr. Werner, agreed that the patent teaches that the gate electrode is made sufficiently conductive, when the source and drain are doped, without further processing; the patent teaches these aspects at page 3, lines 5 to 7, because it states "The difficult step of
subsequently
applying electrodes or a conductive film to critical regions of an intricate pattern is eliminated" and at page 4, lines 29 to 32, "During diffusion the silicon layer is doped with impurities also so that it becomes sufficiently conductive to function as a conductive film on the gate structure"; the patent in the disclosure sets out what the conductivity and sheet resistivity should be; figure 1 shows a remote contact (numbered 20); some witnesses, particularly Dr. Werner agreed that the patent, at least figure 1, showed a remote contact.
[31]
It is my conclusion that the patent and the evidence do not support the construction which the plaintiff wishes to draw from them. Specifically, with respect to the evidence of Dr. Werner, he merely agreed to words which were put into his mouth, so to speak, by counsel for the plaintiff. There is no indication that he understood exactly the distinction counsel was seeking to address, whether the patent required that the polysilicon be made sufficiently conductive at the time the source and drain were doped so as to require no further processing or whether the conductivity achieved by that process might be enhanced by some subsequent step in the fabrication process. With respect to the alleged remote contact teaching, Dr. Werner's attention was drawn to figure 1 not to the claims of the patent. Again, I am not convinced that he understood the conclusion which counsel was seeking to have established by the question being asked. While some witnesses testified that the patent teaches the aspects which counsel argues are part of the invention, others testified to the contrary. As noted above, the construction of the patent is a question for the court.
[32]
With respect to the conductivity of the polysilicon layer of the gate, the patent teaches that the polysilicon will become the gate electrode but it does not state that the conductivity required will necessarily be achieved at the same time as the source and drain are doped. At the February 1966 meeting it was contemplated that the polysilicon might not be sufficiently conductive and that another material (platinum) might be added to increase conductivity if necessary. Dr. Kerwin's description in his lab book on May 31, 1966 also contemplated that such a step might be necessary:
"make contact to various Si surfaces of interest by evaporating Pt (at low angle of incidence ..."
The quotation from page 10 of the patent set out above expressly contemplates the possibility of conductivity enhancement by an additional step. What is most important, however, none of the claims in issue state that the gate is rendered sufficiently conductive at the same time as the source and drain are doped. Claim one specifically states that the gate may be rendered conductive either "simultaneous or separately".
[33]
With respect to remote contacts for the interconnection of the transistor gate to a voltage source, it must first be noted that in designing integrated circuits it is always desirable to use as little space as possible for each device. One way of saving space is to have the metallization contact point for the gate directly over the gate. This, however, is not always possible. Transistors have different configurations, depending on the function they are to serve. Some (high gain) have a very short channel length. In such cases it is not possible to make the contact with the interconnecting metal directly over the gate. In such cases, the gate can be run into a contact pad which is connected to but not directly over the gate.
[34]
While figure 1 of the plaintiff's patent shows a remote contact pad (number 20 of figure 1) there is not a word in claims 1, 9 or 10 about metallization or the interconnection step. In addition, the fabrication process set out by Dr. Klein after the February 1966 meeting and the description of the invention set out in his lab book by Dr. Kerwin on May 31, 1966 both contemplated a subsequent metallization step but did not elaborate thereon. The metallization or interconnection step was simply not part of the invention. Page 10 of the patent contains the only reference to this step:
"A standard photo resist and etch operation is performed followed by a metallization, photo resist and etch to form the electrode pads 18, 19 and 20 (Fig. 1). The silicon layer is itself conductive but a thicker metal coating such as gold or aluminum improves the interconnections. The presence of a dual conduction path contributes to a higher yield in the event of a discontinuity in one of the layers."
There is nothing in the patent which teaches that remote contact on the pad is part of the invention.
[35]
In my view, it is reading far too much into the patent to adopt the interpretation of the patent which counsel for the plaintiff proposes. The patent teaches that the polysilicon will act as a gate electrode but whether it will be rendered sufficiently conductive for this purpose at the same time as the source and drain are doped or by some later and additional enhancement step is not part of the teaching of the patent. There is no teaching that remote contact is part of the invention, in the patent.
[36]
The invention can be described in general terms as one of choosing to use silicon as the gate electrode, instead of using a metal, and of fabricating the gate source and drain "backwards". That is first depositing the gate insulator and the gate electrode on top of the silicon substrate, then etching out the layers above the source and drain regions and doping the source, drain and gate regions with the polysilicon on the gate ultimately becoming conductive for use as the gate electrode.
IV
Infringement
[37]
During the years 1979 to 1982, the defendant Mitel manufactured Mosfets using a vapour deposition method to introduce impurities into the source and drain; this process was known as the VIB process. During a brief transitional period in 1982 a process referred to as V2 Diffusion was used. It was also a vapour deposition method. From 1982 to 1987 (the date of the expiry of the patent) a V2 Process was used. It introduced the impurities by ion implantation rather than by vapour deposition. I do not think it necessary to set out in detail the evidence which supports the conclusion that the VIB, V2 Diffusion and V2P processes infringe claim one, subject to the arguments noted below. The fact that the Mitel processes were much more complex than those described in the Kerwin patent does not detract from the fact that the essential steps of the patent are found in those processes. It is sufficient to say that the evidence supporting the conclusion that infringement occurred, subject to the arguments below, is found in the testimony given by Dr. Yaney and in the Mitel discovery evidence of Mr. Jean Deslauriers. It is admitted that claim 9 and 10 of the patent have been infringed by the defendant if those claims are valid.
Ion Implantation
[38]
The defendant argues that, since the V2 Process was an ion implantation process, no infringement of the plaintiff's patent took place when it was fabricating devices using that technology.
[39]
Ion implantation involves "shooting" phosphorous ions into the silicon substrate by means of a high velocity gun. Once implanted the substances must be heated, as in the vapour deposition process, to move the ions into the required substitutional positions in the silicon crystal lattice. This heating process, as in the case of vapour deposition, broadens and deepens the wells so that they take up their final form in the substrate. In the ion implantation process the heat also performs an annealing function. This is required in order to repair damage to the silicon crystal lattice which occurs as a result of the "shooting-in" of the ions.
[40]
Ion implantation gives a more controlled process for creating the source and drain regions than does vapour deposition; the depth of the well and its breadth can be more easily controlled; the tuck under the gate can be more closely defined. In the ion implantation process, while on initial entry into the substrate there is a scattering of ions under the gate, this effect is less pronounced than in the case of vapour deposition.
[Diagram omitted. See printed version.]
Thus, with ion implantation one can achieve a much shorter channel length than is the case with vapour deposition. The concentration of impurities is also somewhat different. With vapour deposition the most concentrated region is at the surface. With ion implantation it is below the surface. There is less total impurity used in the implant process, about one-half as much as is used in vapour deposition. It is my understanding that while the ion implantation method could be used to achieve results similar to vapour deposition it is a more refined and controllable process therefore can achieve more refined and controlled results the most important of which is the shorter channel length.
[41]
In both the ion implantation process used by the defendant and in the vapour deposition process used by the defendant, the silicon gate electrode acts as a mask for the creation of the source and drain, and the silicon gate becomes conductive to operate as the gate electrode.
[42]
In 1965-1966, ion implantation was known as a process for introducing impurities into silicon but it was "a laboratory curiosity of very great difficulty to perform". The equipment was expensive; it operated so as to introduce impurities one wafer at a time and therefore was time consuming. Vapour deposition was used to process batches of wafers. In addition the ion implantation process was thought to be a low temperature process. The fact that a high temperature step was needed to move the ions into the required positions and to anneal the crystal lattice was not fully understood.
[43]
By 1970 more was known about ion implantation that had been the case in 1966. A paper had been given by Dill and Bower (Exhibit D-31) which included reference to the use of ion implantation as a method of forming the source and drain and using the gate electrode as a mask. A patent application had been issued to Bower (Exhibit D-49) with respect to the use of ion implantation as a method for making sources and drains and the use of gate electrodes as a mask. (It is not clear that the method described in the patent would have worked since ion implantation was still thought of as a low temperature process.) It was known in the industry that Hughes Aircraft was looking at replacing the standard vapour deposition procedures with ion implantation.
Infringement - Letal Test
[44]
The test to be applied is whether the substance ("pith and marrow") of the plaintiff's invention was taken when the ion implantation process was used. The applicable test is set out by Mr. Justice Mahoney in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 146 affirmed (1984), 53 N.R. 6; 80 C.P.R.(2d) 1, at 35 (F.C.A.) subnomine  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  storage wells of a battery which deformed (squeezed) metal lugs was held to infringe a patent which contemplated that the connection would be made by filling the relevant aperture with metal additional to that comprising the lugs. At page 146 of his decision, Mr. Justice Mahoney adopted the principles set out in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  is very likely a commercial improvement on that of the connector patent. Lugs with cast on projections have to be more expensive than those without, all else being equal, and the evidence is clear that the alignment of opposing lugs is not so critical in the defendant's process as the connector patent contemplates.
"The principle to be applied was stated in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  reversed [1934] 3 D.L.R. 737] as follows:
'In each case the substance, or principle, of the invention and not the mere form is to be looked to. It has been stated in many cases that if an infringer takes the principle and alters the details, and yet it is obvious that he has taken the substance of the idea which is the subject matter of the invention, and has simply altered the details, the court is justified in looking through the variation of details and see that the substance of the invention has been infringed and consequently can protect the inventor. And the question is not whether the substantial part of the machine or method has been taken from the specification, but the very different one, whether what is done by the alleged infringer takes from the patentee the substance of his invention.'
"In my view, the defendant has appropriated the invention of the connection patent. The refinement of creating the projections during the 'squeeze' stage may well be a significant improvement on the patented method but that is what it remains; it is not a new or different method. The substance of the patented method remains in the defendant's method. As has been said, perhaps more colourfully that the present situation warrants,
'... if the pith and marrow of the invention is taken it is no excuse to say that you have added something, or omitted something, even if the addition or omission be useful and valuable. The superadding of ingenuity to a robbery does not make the operation justifiable.'" (footnotes omitted)
[45]
An additional explanation as to the applicable test for the construction of a patent is set out in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (H.L.), applied recently in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  it was said:
"... both parties to this appeal have tended to treat 'textual infringement' and infringement of the 'pith and marrow' of an invention as if they were separate causes of action, the existence of the former to be determined as a matter of construction only and of the latter upon some broader principle of colourable evasion. There is, in my view, no such dichotomy; there is but a single cause of action and to treat it otherwise, particularly in cases like that which is the subject of the instant appeal, is liable to lead to confusion.
. . . . .
"My Lords, a patent specification is a unilateral statement by the patentee, in words of his own choosing, addressed to those likely to have a practical interest in the subject matter of his invention (i.e. 'skilled in the art'), by which he informs them what he claims to be the essential features of the new product or process for which the letters patent grant him a monopoly. It is those novel features only that he claims to be essential that constitute the so-called 'pith and marrow' of the claim. A patent specification should be given a purposive construction rather than a purely literal one derived from applying to it the kind of meticulous verbal analysis in which lawyers are too often tempted by their training to indulge. The question in each case is: whether persons with practical knowledge and experience of the kind of work in which the invention was intended to be used, would understand that strict compliance with a particular descriptive word or phrase appearing in a claim was intended by the patentee to be an essential requirement of the invention so that any variant would fall outside the monopoly claimed, even though it could have no material effect upon the way the invention worked.
"The question, of course, does not arise when the variant would in fact have a material effect upon the way the invention worked. Nor does it arise unless at the date of publication of the specification it would be obvious to the informed reader that this was so. Where it is not obvious, in the light of then-existing knowledge, the reader is entitled to assume that the patentee thought at the time of the specification that he had good reason for limiting his monopoly so strictly and had intended to do so even though subsequent work by him or others in the field of the invention might show the limitation to have been unnecessary. It is to be answered in the negative only when it would be apparent to any reader skilled in the art that a particular descriptive work or phrase used in a claim cannot have been intended by a patentee, who was also skilled in the art, to exclude minor variants which, to the knowledge of both him and the readers to whom the patent was addressed, could have no material effect upon the way in which the invention worked."
[46]
The particular patent in issue related to steel lintels. The patent described the lintel as having a back plate "extending vertically". At page 243 of its decision the court phrased the question, that it must ask itself, as whether a person familiar with building operations would think that the patentee in using the words "extending vertically" had intended to exclude lintels in which the back plate was not positioned at 90 [degrees] but was close enough to make no material difference on the way the lintel worked. The court responded to its own question:
"... No plausible reason had been advanced why any rational patentee should want to place so narrow a limitation on his invention. On the contrary, to do so would render his monopoly for practical purposes worthless, since any imitator could avoid it and take all the benefit of the invention by the simple expedient of positioning the back plate a degree or two from the exact vertical."
[47]
The principles relating to the construction of patents set out in the jurisprudence are: (1) in construing a patent one must adopt a purposive construction and not engage in an overclose parsing of the words; (2) the question that must always be asked is whether the "pith and marrow", or the substance of the plaintiff's invention, has been taken; (3) if a variant of an aspect of a claim has no material effect on the way the invention works there is a presumption that the patent is infringed and that the patentee intended that that variant fall within the scope of the claim; (4) the question that must always be asked however, is whether the patentee intended to include or exclude equivalents (variants) from the scope of the invention claimed; (5) the patentee's intention in this regard is not his actual intention, if that could in any event be ascertained with any degree of certainty, but it is the intention of the patentee as expressed in the text of the patent, read in the light of surrounding circumstances, specifically the knowledge of those skilled in the art.
[48]
There is good reason for adopting a purposive approach to the construction of the patents. It is not the inventor who drafts these texts. It is usually a legal advisor who presumably has some knowledge of the particular art to which the patent relates but who, for legal reasons related to the patenting process, adopts wording quite different from that in which most inventors would explain their invention.
[49]
The question which is left unanswered by the Catnic decision is whether knowledge at the date of the patent of the existence of variants generally, or of the particular variant in issue, is necessary in order to find that a variant was intended by the patentee to fall within the scope of the patent. As I understand counsel for the defendant's argument it is that since ion implantation was not known as a practical method of doping the source and drain as of the date on which the application for the patent was filed, it cannot possibly have been the patentee's intention to include that variant (if minor variant or equivalent it is) within the scope of the patent.
[50]
I cannot disguise the fact that I have some difficulty interpreting part of the text of the Catnic decision, particularly those sentences which for purposes of convenience I will set out again below:
"... Nor does it [the question as to whether the patentee intended to exclude minor variants from his claim] arise unless at the date of publication of the specification it would be obvious to the informed reader that this was so. Where it is not obvious, in the light of the then-existing knowledge, the reader is entitled to assume that the patentee thought at the time of the specification that he had good reason for limiting his monopoly so strictly and had intended to do so even though subsequent work by him or others in the field of the invention might show the limitation to have been unnecessary."
[51]
The Catnic decision did not deal with a situation where the variant in issue was not fully understood at the date of the patent. Nor did it deal with a situation in which it was alleged that there were no variants in existence at the date of the patent. I understand the portion of the decision in the Catnic case set out above to stand for no more than that, in determining whether a patentee intended to exclude equivalents or minor variants from his claims, that construction has to be determined as of the date of the patent.
Date As Of Which Patent To Be Construed
[52]
The patentee's intention with respect to the inclusion or exclusion of minor variants or equivalents must be determined as of the "date of the patent". But is the "date of the patent", for this purpose, the date of the issue of the patent or the date as of which the patent application was filed?
[53]
Counsel for the plaintiff argues that a patent is to be construed as of the date of its issue. In this case the patent application was filed in the United States on March 27, 1967. The Canadian filing date was February 6, 1968. The Canadian patent issued October 6, 1970. As noted above, ion implantation was a laboratory curiosity at the date of the filing of the patent application; but more was known about it and the date of the issue of the patent. Specifically, the Bower patent of 1969 suggested ion implantation could be used with whatever material to form the source and drain regions.
[54]
Counsel for the plaintiff's argument, that it is the date of the issue of the patent which must govern, is based on the decisions in:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 141 (J.C.P.C.);  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ch. D.). He cites as well as Dr. Fox's text, Canadian Patent Law and Practice (1969, 4th Ed.). In that text, it is stated at pages 206-207:
"The specification is to be construed both as to intelligibility and sufficiency by reference to the state of public knowledge existing
at the date of the patent
. The true interpretation is to be arrived at by considering what a skilled mechanic reading the specification
at the date of the grant
would have understood the patentee to have claimed. For this purpose the court will eliminate all subsequent knowledge, and all knowledge that would not be possessed by a workman skilled in the art to which the invention related ..." (underlining added)
However as a footnote to that text Dr. Fox wrote an extensive analysis of the various cases concluding with these comments:
"The English cases all refer to the date of the patent on this point but it must be remembered that date of invention is there immaterial on the question of priority.
"It would, therefore, appear important that these two reference dates should be kept in mind but, in order to avoid turgidity, the expression 'date of the patent' will usually be used. But it must be borne in mind that there is a division of opinion that must remain until an authoritative judgment settles the point."
[55]
Counsel for the plaintiff argues that an authoritative decision is found in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (S.C.C.) at pages 101-102:
"... The claims are part of the specification, it 'ends' with them under the
Act
. What must be ascertained is what the whole meant
at the date of the patent
to a person skilled in the art.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ... Lord Reid said at page 141 ..." (underlining added)
[56]
A close examination of all the cases cited by counsel for the plaintiff, including the Burton Parsons case and the Minerals Separation case, reveals, however, that none of them addresses the issue of whether a patent should be construed as of the date of its issue or as the date of the filing of the application. All the cases cited assume that the state of the art is the same at both periods of time. This is particularly true of the Minerals Separation case, which is so often quoted. In the Minerals Separation case the issue was the meaning of "alkaline xanthate". The court concluded that it was meaningless; the court noted at page 141 that a person to whom the patent was addressed:
"... would probably have to consult an organic chemist. He would then discover, if he did not know it already, that there is no such thing as an alkaline xanthate: ..."
There was no evidence referred to in the Mineral Separation case, however, indicating that persons at any date would have known what an "alkaline xanthate" was. It was meaningless at the date of the patent; it was meaningless before the patent was issued and afterwards as well. Mr. Justice Collier in the Xerox case referred to the date of the issue of the patent and cited the American Cyanamid case. But there is no indication in either of these cases that the issue of the appropriate date was raised.
[57]
In most cases there may be little need to distinguish between the two dates. In cases where the state of the art is not a fast evolving one there will be no need to be more precise than to refer to "the date of the patent". In the present case the state of the art has evolved with incredible speed and the distinction is important.
[58]
In addition, counsel for the defendant pointed out there are references in the jurisprudence which indicate that the date of the filing of the patent application, not the date of its issue, is the date as of which a patent should be construed. In the Minerals Separation case itself such references exist. In that case the patent application was filed on October 23, 1923; the patent issued on September 22, 1985. President Thorson at page 346 of his decision, reported in [1947] Ex. C.R. 306, referred to evidence of the state of the art in 1923; Mr. Justice Kellock, in the Supreme Court, did likewise, at pages 59 and 60 of his decision which is found at [1950] S.C.R. 36.
[59]
In my view, the relevant date to consider is the date as of which the patent application is filed. As counsel for the defendant argues such a conclusion accords with the basic principles governing the interpretation of any legal document, that such documents are interpreted in the light of the circumstances existing at the time they are written. It accords with sections 52 to 54 of the Patent Rules which state that no new matters can be added by amendment to an application. It avoids bizarre results which might arise in a fast moving area of technology if the issue of the patent is delayed. With respect to this last, it was noted that the issue of a patent can be held up for many years in the patent office when conflict proceedings are instituted. And, lastly, Mr. Justice Noel in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at page 204, and quoted a passage part of which reads as follows:
"It must not, however, be forgotten that the meaning of words is liable to change with the progress of science and discovery, and a term which, for the purpose of the specification, is sufficiently accurate, may, in future years, include that which will not answer the purpose the patentee has in view. In such a case the specification will be read with reference to the state of knowledge
at the time it was prepared
..." (underlining added)
Patentee's Intention Re: Minor Variants
[60]
It must be asked, in accordance with the Catnic test, whether the patentee intended to exclude minor variants relating to the particular aspect of the patent in issue from the scope of the patent claim. As already noted, that intention is to be found in the text of the patent read in light of surrounding circumstances, particularly the knowledge of one skilled in the art. Applying that test, I do not find that the patentee intended to exclude minor variants in the way the source, drain and gate were doped from the scope of the patent in issue in this case.
[61]
In my view, the text of claim one does not expressly exclude such minor variants or equivalents. The claim does not specify that the diffusion has to take place by way of vapour deposition, although that is the process described in the preferred embodiment. The claim does not specify that the diffusion must occur by placing a film of impurity or the surface and letting it soak in. The claim asserts no specificity with respect to the manner in which the impurities are to be introduced. The aspect in issue is described as "diffusing impurities into the semiconductor substrate to form the diffusion layer ... diffusing impurities into the silicon layer to render it conductive". It is clear from the evidence that the word "diffusing" or "diffusion" was and is used in a variety of ways, some more precise than others. I cannot conclude that the patentees intended to exclude, from the scope of claim one of the patent, methods of placing impurities into the source, drain and gate regions which do not involve an initial step of coating the surface of the exposed substrate with the impurity atoms and allowing them to soak into the area immediately below.
[62]
Counsel for the defendant argued that such an interpretation could leave the patentee open to a challenge that the claim was too broadly drafted. He argued that on the basis of the state of knowledge at the time the patent was drafted, it was possible that ion implantation might turn out to be completely impractical for use with the silicon gate mask; the ions might have smashed right through the polysilicon instead of merely rendering it conductive. In that event, he argued that if the patent included introducing impurities by means of ion implantation it would have been invalid. That argument is not convincing. If the method of introducing the impurities was one that did not work with the invention or did not need the invention to work then there would be no argument that it was an equivalent or variant in the context of the claim of the patent.
[63]
The fact that ion implantation at the date of the invention and at the date of the filing of the patent application was a laboratory curiosity, and was not fully understood as being a practical means of forming a source and drain, does not mean that that process, when developed in a practical form, cannot fall within the claims of the patent. It is not necessary that a patentee have an actual variant in contemplation (or have been able to have such in contemplation) for it to fall within the scope of the patent providing that the patent as drafted does not exhibit an intention to exclude from its claims minor variants or equivalents with respect to the particular aspect of the process in issue. If the situation were otherwise patentees would lose the protection granted to them by the Patent Act merely because someone devised a new technology for accomplishing one of the unessential steps involved in the claim at sometime subsequent to the granting of the patent. I do not think this was intended by the legislation.
Ion Implantation - Minor Variant/or Functional Equivalent
[64]
The question still to be addressed is whether ion implantation is a minor variant and as of what date that assessment should be made. In my view, the comparison is to be made as of the date of the alleged infringement. There is nothing in the case law which indicates otherwise. As already noted, in 1965, ion implantation was not a practical means of rendering the source, drain and gate conductive for purposes of fabricating Mosfets. However, it was subsequently to become such. The test to be applied in determining whether the defendant's use of ion implantation takes the defendant's method of fabrication out of the scope of the patent is set out in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  case elaborates the principles respecting the taking of the substance of an invention. At page 55 Thorson, P., stated:
"It has long been established that if a person takes the substance of an invention he is guilty of infringement even if his act does not in every respect fall within the express terms of the claim defining it. This basic principle was stated as early as 1875 by James, L.J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  takes the substance of an invention he is guilty of infringement and it does not matter whether he omits a feature that is not essential to it or substitutes an equivalent for it. The case of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and the case of Benno Jaffe and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Gas Light Company case (supra) Willis, J., held that the defendants had taken the substance of the patentee's invention, notwithstanding the fact that they used a prescription that was somewhat different from that described in the specification and omitted a substance that had been specified in the specification and accordingly included in the patentee's claim. On appeal to the Court of Appeal (1896), 13 R.P.C. 559 his judgment was unanimously affirmed."
and at pages 67-68:
"The decision in The Rheostatic Company Limited case (supra) is to the same effect. There the Lord Justice Clerk (Aitchison) said, at page 118:
'The broad test of infringement is whether the alleged infringer has taken the real substance of the invention as claimed, what Lord Cairns called "the pith and marrow" of the invention. The devices need not be absolutely similar, there may be variation, either addition or subtraction or substitution, and in each case it must be a question of fact whether the variation makes any real difference or is merely a distinction without a difference. An infringement is rarely an exact replica of the device infringed -'
"This statement was approved by Lord Hill Watson in Lyle and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 147.
"There is a further illustration of the same kind in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  handles for use on caskets and other receptacles. Claim 2 was as follows:
'2. A handle comprising a base member having an opening and provided with a pivot bar extended across the opening; and a grip insertable into the opening and having a slot receiving the pivot bar, the slot defining a bendable finger in the grip, the finger having a lug adapted to engage the base member at the lower edge of the opening, the finger and the lug co-operating with the base member, when the grip is raised, to secure a bending of the finger, a partial closing of the slot and a pivotal mounting of the grip on the bar.'
"The defendant's handle differed from the plaintiff's in that the two members of its handle were locked by a mechanical operation instead of by hand, as described in the claim. The then President of this court held that this difference was not sufficient to save the defendant from the charge of infringement, its means of locking the handle being the equivalent of the means used by the plaintiff. His decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada. At page 443, Rinfret, J., as he then was said:
'What the appellant did -- and in that his infringement truly consists -- was to take the idea which formed the real subject matter of the invention. It does not matter whether he also adopted the substitution of the two holes for the bar in the pivoting means. The precise forms of these means was immaterial.'"
[65]
I have no doubt that the defendant's method of introducing the impurities into the substrate and polysilicon layer of the gate falls into the category of an equivalent or variant which has no material effect on the way the invention works. In the first place the method of introducing the impurities is
not part of the invention
. The Federal Court of Appeal dealt with this type of situation in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 1. The issue in that case was whether the substrate of a fabric softener which was not constructed as a web could be said to constitute an infringement of the patent. The Federal Court of Appeal held at page 18:
"... The substrate quite apparently not being part of the invention it becomes one of the minor variants to which Lord Duplock referred in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case, supra, 'which could have no material effect on the way
the invention worked
' (emphasis added). The fact that the Cling Free substrate may not be a web can have no bearing on the question of infringement in this case."
Similarly, in the present case, the method of introducing the impurities into the source, drain and gate regions is not part of the invention.
[66]
There is no doubt that the two processes, ion implantation and vapour deposition, are quite different processes
as methods of placing impurities
into the substrate and the gate regions. But the question of equivalence or functionality has to be assessed by reference to the invention claimed not by an abstract comparison of the two methods. Whether the method of introducing impurities be that of vapour deposition or that ion implantation, the polysilicon gate operates as a mask for the creation of a self-aligned source and drain and the polysilicon is doped to become conductive to act as the gate. While the two processes, ion implantation and vapour deposition, are different as between themselves, the choice of one or the other does not make a material difference to the way the invention works.
V
Validity
[67]
The defendant's position is that the AT&T patent is invalid because Messrs. Klein, Kerwin and Sarace were not the first to invent and there existed a patent application in the patent office at the time the AT&T patent was filed, with which it should have been put in conflict.
[68]
The applicable test for an "invention date" was summarized by the Supreme Court of Canada in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at p. 456, affirmed (1931), 48 R.P.C. 356 (P.C.) as follows:
"The holding here, therefore, is that by the date of discovery of the invention is meant the date at which the inventor can prove he has first formulated, either in writing or verbally, a description which affords the means of making that which is invented. There is no necessity of a disclosure to the public. If the inventor wishes to get a patent, he will have to give the consideration to the public; but, if he does not and if he makes no application for the patent, while he will run the risk of enjoying no monopoly, he will nonetheless, if he has communicated his invention to 'others', be the first and true inventor in the eyes of the Canadian patent law as it now stands, so as to prevent any other person from securing a Canadian patent for the same invention."
[69]
Section 27(1) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4, accords to the
first inventor
the right to the grant of a patent:
"27(1) Subject to this section, any inventor or legal representative of an inventor of an invention that was
(a)
not known or used by any other person
before he invented it,
(b) not described in any patent or in any publication printed in Canada or in any other country more than two years before presentation of the petition hereunder mentioned, and
(c) not in public use or on sale in Canada for more than two years prior to his application in Canada,
may, on presentation to the Commissioner of a petition setting out the facts, in this Act termed the filing of the application, and on compliance with all other requirements of this Act, obtain a patent granting to him an exclusive property in the invention." (underlining added)
Section 61 qualifies the "first inventor" requirement:
"61(1) No patent or claim in a patent shall be declared invalid or void on the ground that, before the invention therein defined was made by the inventor by whom the patent was applied for, it had already been known or used by some other person, unless it is established that
(a) that other person had, before the date of the application for the patent, disclosed or used the invention in such manner that it had become available to the public;
(b)
that other person had, before the issue of the patent, made an application for patent in Canada on which conflict proceedings should have been directed; or
(c) that other person had at any time made an application in Canada which, by virtue of s. 28 had the same force and effect as if it had been filed in Canada before the issue of the patent and on which conflict proceedings should properly have been directed had it been so filed." (underlining added)
And s. 43(1) defines the circumstances in which patent applications conflict:
"43(1) Conflict between two or more pending applications exists
(a) when each of them contains one or more claims defining substantially the same invention; or
(b) when one or more claims of one application describe the invention disclosed in one of the other applications."
GMe Work
[70]
A polysilicon gate field effect transistor was fabricated by individuals at General Micro-electronics Inc. (GMe) some time in late 1964 or early 1965. This was approximately a year before Messrs. Kerwin, Klein and Sarace started their work. The process of fabrication used by GMe was one in which the layers of substrate, gate insulator and polysilicon gate electrode were put together first and then the source and drain regions were defined by an etching process and doped using the polysilicon gate as a self-aligning mask.
[71]
That this occurred is clear from Mr. Farina's evidence and I do not doubt him. Mr. Farina did not have a very clear recollection of the events surrounding this development. He could not "swear" whether the device was made before or after March 30, 1965. That date was one on which a memorandum was written to him by a member of his staff mentioning the silicon gate process. He thought it more likely than not that the device was fabricated before that date. It is many years since the events transpired. Mr. Farina in attempting to recount those events had some difficulty and from time to time exhibited some inconsistency in his evidence. This strengthens rather than weakens his credibility.
[72]
Mr. Farina recalled seeing the silicon gate Mosfets tested, in 1965, using curve tracer probes to the source, drain and gate. This testing was similar to that which Dr. Klein had seen performed on the devices made at Bell Labs; in May of 1966. The testing was a standard type of procedure. The GMe transistors were not metallized. Indeed, the devices could not be metallized initially because GMe did not have the masks required for this process. GMe was not, at the time, in a position to devote time and money to the development of those masks. Mr. Farina remembers seeing the curve tracer probes slip on the silicon surface. Portions of a deposition given by Mr. Farina in proceedings in 1973 seem to contradict his statement that the devices were not metallized. There are some difficulties with this evidence. In the first place the deposition refers to diagrams that were not available and thus not put before Mr. Farina on the present occasion, to help refresh his memory as to exactly what he was saying at the earlier time. In any event, I accept his present evidence concerning the fabrication and testing of nonmetallized devices.
[73]
Mr. Farina's evidence is supported by that of Mr. Norman and Mr. Watkins. In addition, there is clear objective evidence supporting Mr. Farina's recollection that a silicon gate Mosfet was made by GMe during the time in question. In June of 1965, the United States Air Force electronics group at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio requested the submission of proposals with respect to the development of large scale circuit arrays. These were requested by the Air Force from a number of companies with the intention of awarding contracts to some of those companies. GMe was one of the companies to which a request for a proposal was sent. GMe responded and its proposal was received by the Air Force on August 9, 1965. That proposal was directed to metal gate MOS technology. It also included, however, a section on the polycrystalline silicon gate process. The relevant parts of that proposal read as follows:
"
Self-aligning Gates
. One of the fundamental limitations in the alignment of larger arrays is the alignment of the gate-thinning mask. Techniques have been devised wherein a polycrystalline silicon gate can be employed to provide for an automatic positioning of the gate. This is done by employing the polycrystalline gate as the actual mask for positioning the P-region source and drain.
. . . . .
"
Use of Polycrystalline Silicon for Resistors, Crossovers and Self-Aligning Gates
"Work done at GMe in the R & D area with polycrystalline silicon has been very encouraging. It appears that the use of polycrystalline silicon can provide many of the much needed features and advancements required for the fabrication of large arrays. The following will summarize work done to date and will illustrate how the employment of polycrystalline silicon can significantly improve the probability of meeting the large array objectives required.
. . . . .
"
Self-Aligning Gates
. Polycrystalline silicon requires a different etch solution to etch the silicon than that of silicon dioxide, therefore polycrystaline [sic] silicon can be used as a mask instead of Kodak photo-resist. This fact can be used to great advantage in terms of fabrication of large arrays where a great improvement must be obtained in the alignment of the gate region.
"Polycrystalline silicon can be used as a mask to provide for self-aligning or automatic alignment of gates in the following manner. (See Fig. 2-31, a thru d.) After the silicon is evaporated on to the surface of the silicon dioxide, the silicon then can be etched away using a normal polycrystalline silicon etch leaving the desired silicon resistors, desired silicon crossunders, and other regions which will later form silicon gates. Holes are then etched in the oxide using the silicon as a mask against the oxide etch thereby forming windows for the P-diffusion. Since the silicon essentially replaces the metal gate conductor, this results in the gate being automatically positioned with respect to the source and drain since it was the silicon mask that formed the source and drain.
"
The silicon gate region can then be metallized in a normal manner to increase the gate contact conductivity
. Mos threshold voltages of six volts have been achieved at GMe using this technique wherein the rest of the process has been relatively standard. Another important attribute of such a scheme for forming the gate region is that since the gate is automatically aligned there is no overlap of the gate with respect to the source and drain except for the underdiffusion that normally would take place. That is, since alignment tolerances do not have to be provided for, then the usual two to four microns of metal overlap need not be provided. The elimination of this metal overlap can significantly reduce, the Miller capacity which so greatly limits the speed performance of sing-polarity Mos digital circuits and also linear circuits. Such a technique could provide a factor of two improvement in the speed capability of present Mos devices. This, coupled with silicon crossovers, could improve the speed even more."
[74]
There was enough information contained in this description, together with the diagrams which accompanied it, to enable a person skilled in the art to put the invention into practice. Many of the steps required would be standard and a person skilled in the art would not have to be explicitly instructed with respect to them.
[75]
As noted above, Mosfets can be either enhancement mode devices or depletion mode devices. An enhancement mode device is one in which there should be no channel and thus no flow of current when there is no voltage applied to the gate. In the mid-1960's, it was very difficult to make a N-channel enhancement device. Mr. Norman said "You got an unwanted induced channel with N-channel devices just by looking at it cross-eyed". It was very difficult to fabricate a device which would completely shut off because the fabrication techniques which were used resulted in some impurities or contamination existing within the gate insulator. These, minute amounts of impurities which were present at all times meant there was conductivity at all times. This effect was known as "inversion".
[76]
GMe was a small company. While a device as described had been fabricated this had been despite rather than because of management instructions. Mr. Farina, Mr. Watkins and others working for the company, had been instructed to devote their attention to problems which the company was having with its existing fabrication processes. In January 1966, GMe was purchased by Philco-Ford. Funds became more easily available for development work with respect to the use of the polysilicon gate electrode.
[77]
GMe at the time was using silicon dioxide as the gate insulator. This was standard practice since silicon dioxide, at the time, was the gate insulator of choice. The thicker the silicon dioxide gate insulator layer, however, the higher the gate voltage needed to be to operate the device. Thus a thin dioxide layer was desirable. But, a thin dioxide layer tended to develop pinholes as a result of the etching processes to which it was subjected. Pinholes led to shorting of the device. The metal used to form the gate electrode (typically aluminum) would migrate through the holes. A lower gate threshold voltage was possible with a silicon gate electrode then with a metal gate. Thus, GMe in 1966 was exploring the use of polysilicon as a gate material for the purpose of obtaining several advantages therefrom.
[78]
A Mr. Selser had been hired by GMe sometime after the initial work on the silicon gate transistor, described in the 1965 proposal to the Air Force, had been done. In June of 1966, Messrs. Watkins and Selser attended a conference at which they learned more than they had known previously about the solid state physics of the polysilicon gate device. A paper at that conference noted that the work function was higher for a silicon gate than for an aluminum gate and that a silicon gate electrode would give a lower threshold voltage for P-channel devices and a higher threshold voltage for N-channel devices than was the case with aluminum. A lower threshold voltage for P-channel devices meant lower power was required or alternately a thicker gate oxide could be used thereby enhancing the reliability of the device. The higher threshold voltage for N-channel devices meant that N-channel devices could be made without the inversion problem.
[79]
The fabrication of the device "backwards", whereby the gate insulator and gate electrode were put in place before doping of the source and drain, and the use of polysilicon as the gate electrode, thus, alleviated a number of problems. It allowed a self-alignment of the source, drain and gate regions. This reduced the Miller capacitance and allowed a smaller channel to be used. This, in turn, allowed for more devices to be packed on the same chip (increased packing density) and it enabled the device to act faster. In addition the matched work function (it is not necessary to explain the concept "work function" for the purpose of these reasons) allowed for lower threshold voltages for P-channel devices and meant thicker oxide layers could be used. The inversion problem with N-channel devices was also solved.

In September 26, 1966 a patent application was filed by Messrs. Watkins and Selser. The patent application was filed in the United States on September 26, 1966. Its Canadian counterpart was filed September 5, 1967. The Canadian patent issued October 21, 1969. This will hereafter be referred to as the GMe patent. It reads in part:
"The present invention relates in general to semiconductor devices and finds particular application to metal oxide semiconductor transistors (Mosts's).
"In Metal Oxide Semiconductor Transistors (Most's) a metallic gate electrode or other metallic conductor usually is deposited over an oxide layer on the surface of a semiconductor substrate. Since these conductors have a different work function than the underlying semiconductive material (usually silicon), a potential difference will be created across the oxide layer. The electric field from this potential difference will induce a voltage in the underlying region of the semiconductor which will change the conductivity, or even the conductivity type, of this region. Such a change in conductivity type, termed inversion, is particularly harmful when it occurs, without design, in a region of semiconductive material of one conductivity type which separates regions (e.g. source and drain regions of a (Most) of the opposite conductivity type ...)
"An object of the present invention is the provision of an improved semiconductor device in which undesired inversion between adjacent diffused regions is inhibited.
"The present invention includes a semiconductor assembly comprising a semiconductor body, an oxide layer on a surface of that body, and a layer of polycrystalline silicon on a surface of the oxide layer.
"The present invention also includes a method of making a semiconductor device comprising the steps of forming an oxide layer on a surface of monocrystalline semiconductor body, and forming a polycrystalline silicon layer on a surface of the oxide layer.
. . . . .
"Several advantages are given by the method of the present invention, for example:
(1) A Most is provided wherein polycrystalline silicon serves as an electrostatic shield to reduce undesired inversion between adjacent diffused regions;
. . . . .
(3) A method for producing a Most is given in which polycrystalline silicon is used as a mask for defining the source and drain regions and thereby for forming a self-aligned gate;
. . . . .
"The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows:
1. A semiconductor assembly comprising a semiconductor body, an oxide layer on a surface of the body, and a layer of polycrystalline silicon on a surface of the oxide layer.
. . . . .
5. A semiconductor assembly as claimed in claim 1 and comprising a source region in said body, a drain region in said body spaced from said source region, and a gate disposed above the space between said drain and source regions, said gate being formed of a layer of polycrystalline silicon.
. . . . .
7. A method of making a semiconductor device comprising the steps of forming an oxide layer on a surface of monocrystalline semiconductor body, and forming a polycrystalline silicon layer on a surface of the oxide layer.
. . . . .
9. A method of making a semiconductor device as claimed in claim 7 and comprising the step of removing selected portions of said polycrystalline silicon layer to from openings exposing said oxide layer.
10. A method of making a semiconductor device as claimed in claim 9 and comprising the step of removing portions of said oxide layer exposed by the removal of the selected portions of said polycrystalline silicon to from openings in said oxide layer for the diffusion of source and drain regions in said body.
11. A method of making a semiconductor device as claimed in claim 10 and comprising the step of diffusing through said openings formed in said polycrystalline silicon layer and said oxide layer an impurity to form drain and source regions in said body."
[81]
It is clear that the claims of the GMe patent application filed September 26, 1986 define substantially the same invention as claims 1, 9 and 10 of the AT&T patent.
[82]
Claim 1 of the GMe patent application corresponds to claim 10 of the AT&T application; it describes a semiconductor assembly (a transistor) in which an oxide layer (silicon dioxide) operates as the gate insulator. Silicon dioxide was the gate insulator "of choice" at the time. GMe was using silicon dioxide as the gate insulator. The "oxide layer" would have been understood to have referred to silicon dioxide. The oxide layer is described in the specifications as silicon dioxide.
[83]
Claim 5 of the GMe patent corresponds to claim 9 of the AT&T patent: a semiconductor assembly (a transistor) ... having a gate formed of a layer of polycrystalline silicon.
[84]
Claim 11 of the GMe patent corresponds to claim 1 of AT&T patent. Claim 11 can be rephrased as follows: a method of making a semiconductor device comprising the steps of forming an oxide layer (the insulating layer) on a surface of a monocrystalline semiconductor body and forming a polycrystalline silicon layer on the surface of the oxide layer and removing selected portions of the said polycrystalline silicon layer and the oxide layer to form openings for the diffusion of source and drain regions and the diffusing through the said openings of an impurity to form the drain and source regions.
[85]
There is no doubt that the two patent applications should have been put in conflict.
[86]
Counsel for the defendant raised numerous questions about the GMe patent, for example, why Mr. Selser was named as an inventor when he did not become an employee of GMe until some time after the original work leading to the invention in 1965 had been done. These considerations are not relevant, however, since the validity of the GMe patent is not in issue in this case. All that must be proved is that there was a prior invention of the process, and device, before the plaintiff's invention date and that there were patent applications which should have been put in conflict. This has been proven. The plaintiff's patent is therefore clearly invalid.
VI
Other Challenges
[87]
Other challenges to the AT&T patent were made. My conclusions with respect to them are set out briefly below. The AT&T patent is not invalid by reason of the prior knowledge of Dill, Bowers and Hughes Aircraft. The invention date of the AT&T patent was February, 1966 or at the latest May 31, 1966. The public disclosure by Dill and Bower, in the abstract of a paper presented at the International Electron Devices Meeting of the IREEE, occurred in October 1966.
[88]
The claims are not invalid by reason of the prior publication of the paper by H.S. Lehman entitled Chemical and Ambient Effects on Surface Conduction in Passivated Silicon Semiconductors, in the IBM Journal of Research and Development, vol. 8, no. 4, September 1964. That article describes a controlled experiment testing the conductivity of a variety of substances. It does not teach that silicon, as the gate electrode, has any advantages. The IBM Technical Bulletin of September 1965 by Lehman and Perri, entitled Formation of Depletion and Enhancement Mode Field Effect Transistors, and that by Lehman, Leonard and Perri entitled Fabrication of Field Effect Transistors, however, do constitute anticipation of claims 9 and 10 of the AT&T patent. The second article particularly describes a transistor having a silicon gate electrode. The article does not disclose any advantages relating to the self-aligning gate feature nor does it contemplate "building the device backwards" but it does show using silicon as the gate material. In this regard the test to be applied is that set out in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 157. In that case Mr. Justice Gibson summarized the various alternative tests which have been enunciated in the case law with respect to when anticipation will be said to exist.
[89]
The claims are not invalid for reasons of ambiguity. The phrase "overlying conductive layer having a critical spatial relationship with respect to the diffused region" when read in the context of the patent as a whole would clearly relate to the interrelationships of the source and drain edges to the overlap of the gate. The phrases "diffusing impurities into the semiconductor substrate" and a "diffusion mask" in the context of ion implantation as a method of doping the source and drain are not ambiguous and indefinite. The use of "polycrystalline silicon" in claim 9 is not ambiguous. A person skilled in the art would clearly interpret that description as referring to a polycrystalline silicon which had been made conductive for use as a gate electrode.
[90]
The patent is not invalid for insufficiency of disclosure. The reference in the specifications to the use of silicon nitride alone as a gate insulator without reference to the hysteresis problems, that had been encountered, does not detract from the fact that a useful invention was sufficiently disclosed to enable one skilled in the art to put it into practice. The omission of a reference to the use of silicon oxide as a gate insulator in the specifications does not point away from its use.
[91]
The claims are not invalid for being broader than the invention made nor could the invention be said to have been obvious.
[92]
A lot of evidence was given in this case. I have not referred to it all. I would not want to be taken as having failed to consider aspects of the evidence merely because I have not referred to them. For example, much evidence was given with respect to the diagrams which illustrate the respective patents as well as to the diagram which accompanied GMe's August 1965 proposal to the Air Force. It is clear that these diagrams contain errors. I have chosen to ignore the evidence and argument concerning the diagrams because I do not think they are material enough, for the purposes of the conclusion in this case, to warrant extensive explanation.
VII
Costs
[93]
Counsel argues that costs in the case should be awarded on a basis similar to that by reference to which they were awarded by my colleague, Mr. Justice Cullen, in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.). Indeed a paragraph at page 138 from Mr. Justice Cullen's decision in that case can be directly adapted for the purpose of describing the nature of the present litigation:
"It is fair to comment that this has been a long and difficult process, with some 14 days of trial required, and the transcript running to 2,343 pages. We examined 79 exhibits of the plaintiff and 42 exhibits for the defendant - Exhibit D-14 itself contained 62 documents some of them running to several pages. In addition, we had to deal with the issue of an alleged fraud on the Patent Office. The court was called on to examine three volumes of authorities advanced by the plaintiff and five volumes of authorities by the defendant. Add to this discovery evidence and exhibits plus plaintiff and defendant's List of Documents and one can see how complex and how important counsel believed the issues to be.
"The court now has authority to make a special order as to costs. In the light on my comments above, I believe it is reasonable for the taxing officer to exceed the scale of the tariff, and the plaintiff is to be allowed costs for three counsel which may be allowed above the tariff in this case. The plaintiff is further entitled to all reasonable disbursements and payment for the fees of the three expert witnesses. Caution should be exercised by the taxing officer not to necessarily accept the actual fee charged by each expert, but to use his/her knowledge of what is reasonable in the circumstances for expert fees and disbursements."
[94]
I do not propose to set out the statistics which pertain in this case but they are of a similar order to those which existed in the Control Data case. It is appropriate to award costs on a similar basis.
VIII
Remedies and Conclusion
[95]
Arguments and authorities were presented with respect to remedies and with respect to the applicable limitation periods. Counsel had originally suggested that argument on these might be postponed until a later date. On reflection this was a sensible suggestion. There are no findings of facts or conclusion therefrom that need be made with respect to those issues. Accordingly, I have decided that I need not address them since it is not necessary for this decision.
[96]
The plaintiff's patent will be declared invalid. The defendant shall be entitled to its costs of the action.
Action dismissed.
