Layden-Stevenson, J.
: In 1988, Ms. Kiefer applied for and obtained her Old Age Security (OAS) pension. She was deemed eligible for payment of a full OAS pension with benefits, beginning in the month following her 65th birthday. In June of 2003, after receipt of an anonymous letter, Human Resources and Social Development Canada (HRSDC) conducted a residency review. HRSDC determined, and a ministerial delegate confirmed, that Ms. Kiefer was entitled to a partial, rather than a full OAS pension. Her benefits were recalculated and she was informed that she would have to repay benefits paid to her from September of 1988 through to 2003. The overpayment, originally assessed at $36,982.44, was re-calculated at $19,163.56, in accordance with subsection 37(2) of the
Old Age Security Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. O-9 (the
Act
). Ms. Kiefer appealed the Minister's decision. The Review Tribunal rejected her appeal.
[2]
Ms. Kiefer seeks judicial review of the Review Tribunal's decision and asserts that it erred in concluding that she was not resident in Canada during the applicable years. For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the Review Tribunal's decision was unreasonable and ought to be set aside.
Background
[3]
Ms. Kiefer is 84 years of age. She was born in Nova Scotia in 1923 and lived there until April of 1967 when, at the age of 44, she obtained a United States Alien Registration Card (a green card) to enable her to live and work in the United States (and join Paul Kiefer, an American citizen). Between 1967 and 1972, Ms. Kiefer returned periodically to Nova Scotia. In 1972 she married Mr. Kiefer and in 1975 the couple settled in Florida. In 1978 Mr. Kiefer purchased an apartment in Pompano Beach. Around this time Mr. Kiefer developed a severe, chronic bronchial illness.
[4]
Ms. Kiefer states that, knowing that Mr. Kiefer's health would continue to deteriorate, they decided to get settled in Nova Scotia to enable Ms. Kiefer to be at home and close to her family. In 1980 Mr. Kiefer applied for landed immigrant status in Canada. In 1981 the couple purchased a cottage property in Summerville Beach, Nova Scotia. Between 1981 and 1983 the property was extensively renovated. In 1982 many of their personal belongings, including their vehicle, were shipped to Nova Scotia. From 1983 through to 1991 (the latter being the year of Mr. Kiefer's death) the couple lived in their home in Nova Scotia from spring (early April) until late fall (early November). On some occasions Ms. Kiefer remained in Nova Scotia until January. The evidence indicates that Mr. Kiefer's health was such that he was unable to endure the coldest months of the Canadian winter.
[5]
As previously noted, in June of 2003, after receiving an anonymous letter, HRSDC conducted an audit with respect to Ms. Kiefer. By correspondence dated August 11, 2003, Ms. Kiefer was informed that she was entitled to a partial, rather than a full, OAS pension. Reimbursement of the overpayments was demanded. Ms. Kiefer's appeal to the Review Tribunal was dismissed. When Ms. Kiefer applied for judicial review, the Minister consented to the matter being referred back to a newly constituted Review Tribunal.
[6]
On June 20, 2007, a second Review Tribunal was convened to hear Ms. Kiefer's appeal. By decision dated September 5, 2007, the Review Tribunal dismissed her appeal on the basis that she was not resident in Canada from 1981 to 1988. Consequently, it concluded that Ms. Kiefer is entitled to "partial OAS benefits of 25/40ths, based on residence in Canada from August 25, 1941 to April 1, 1967". It is the decision of the second Review Tribunal that is the subject of this judicial review.
Preliminary Observations
[7]
My first observation concerns the issue of jurisdiction.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), Mr. Justice Létourneau addressed the
Canada Pension Plan
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-8 (the
CPP
). He noted, at paragraph 40, that the
CPP
contains adjudicative and review mechanisms and a process designed to provide an easy, flexible and affordable access to these mechanisms. After discussing previous jurisprudence (whereby decisions of the Review Tribunal were reviewable in the Federal Court while decisions of the Pensions Appeal Board were reviewable in the Federal Court of Appeal), Justice Létourneau commented that Parliament did not envisage "a split of the process between the Federal Court, the Federal Court of Appeal and the adjudicative mechanisms which it put in place and which it invested with broad powers to determine the merits of claims along with all the factual and legal questions that inevitably accompany these claims." In addressing this issue, Justice Létourneau was referring specifically to matters arising pursuant to section 84 of the
CPP
. Having carefully reviewed the reasons in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , as well as the pertinent legislative provisions in this matter, I am satisfied that <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> does not apply to this judicial review and that the Federal Court has jurisdiction.
[8]
The Review Tribunal is created pursuant to section 82 of the
CPP
. Although the drafting of the various provisions is somewhat oblique, subsection 27.1(1) of the
Act
enables an individual, dissatisfied with a decision or determination made under the
Act
, to request reconsideration by the Minister. Subsection 28(1) of the
Act
provides that a person who makes a request under subsection 27.1(1) and who is dissatisfied with the decision of the Minister, may appeal the decision to a Review Tribunal under subsection 82(1) of the
CPP
.
[9]
Complementary provisions are contained in the
CPP
. Subsection 82(1) of the
CPP
states that a party, dissatisfied with a decision of the Minister under subsection 27.1(2) of the
Act
, may appeal the decision to a Review Tribunal. However, subsection 83(1) of the
CPP
, which enables parties to seek leave to appeal decisions of the Review Tribunal (made under section 82 of the
CPP
) to the Pension Appeals Board, specifically excludes decisions made under subsection 28(1) of the
Act
from the operation of subsection 83(1) of the
CPP
. Put another way, subsection 83(1) carves out an exception regarding the right to seek leave to appeal to the Pensions Appeals Board with respect to appeals under subsection 28(1) of the
Act
.
[10]
The only recourse available for unsuccessful appellants, such as Ms. Kiefer (whose appeals to the Review Tribunal were lodged pursuant to subsections 27.1(1) and 28(1) of the
Act
), is to seek judicial review of the Review Tribunal's decision in the Federal Court because no right to seek leave to appeal to the Pensions Appeal Board exists. Rather, it is expressly excluded.
[11]
I raised the issue of jurisdiction with the respondent's counsel at the outset of the hearing. Counsel was of the view, and I concur for the foregoing reasons, that jurisdiction, in matters such as this, lies with the Federal Court.
[12]
My second observation relates to Ms. Kiefer's status as a self-represented litigant. As is often the case, the application record displays a number of irregularities not the least of which is the inclusion of information that was not before the Review Tribunal. That documentation has not been considered on this application. Notably, the respondent's record is also wanting. It is both unorganized and needlessly duplicative. It does, however, include the documentation that was before the Review Tribunal at the outset of the hearing as well as that submitted by Ms. Keifer during the hearing.
[13]
My final preliminary observation is that it is not clear to me, on this record, whether the years in issue are those from 1981 to 1988 or 1983 to 1988. I leave that issue to be explored and decided by a newly-constituted Review Tribunal.
The Decision
[14]
In arriving at its conclusion, the Review Tribunal found:
- Ms. Kiefer had a substantial connection to Nova Scotia during the relevant time period. This connection was evident by virtue of her visits to Nova Scotia in the summer, her ownership of property in the province and her membership on the electoral list (including voting in three federal elections);
- It was the intention of Ms. Kiefer and her husband to retire in Nova Scotia. However, the determination of residency (the factual question of whether a person makes her home and ordinarily lives in Canada) "must be made having regard to all the circumstances and not merely the intention of the appellant";
- Ms. Kiefer failed to meet the test of ordinarily making Nova Scotia her home during the relevant period. She clearly made her home in Florida because:
- She shared a home with her husband in Florida, which they chose to purchase with the intention of making it their permanent residence where Mr. Kiefer's health would be better;
- Ms. Kiefer's residency in Florida was simply a continuation of her residency in the United States, which began in 1967 and continued interrupted until 1988; and
- Ms. Kiefer used the word "home" to describe her annual return to Florida.
[15]
The following evidence was acknowledged by the Review Tribunal but was found not to substantiate Ms. Kiefer's position:
- Evidence that Ms. Kiefer moved some personal effects to Nova Scotia in 1982 was determined to indicate, at best, that she and her husband had the intention of splitting their time between Florida and Canada;
- Mr. Kiefer's landed immigrant status, obtained in 1981, does not support Ms. Kiefer's position because she provided evidence that her husband was always a "permanent resident of the United States in his mind";
- Ms. Kiefer had no legal ownership of property in Florida until her husband's death in 1991. Legal ownership is not significant for the appeal. Rather, it is the actual, physical presence of a person that matters;
- Dr. Doucet's evidence of Ms. Keifer's medical attention in Nova Scotia indicates that she and her husband were essentially summer residents of Nova Scotia;
- Utility and service costs, related to the Nova Scotia property, do not substantiate the appeal without further evidence that the property was actually her home.
The Relevant Statutory Provisions
[16]
The relevant statutory provisions are attached to these reasons as Schedule "A". For ease of reference, section 3 of the
Act
is reproduced below. The term "resided", as it is used in section 3, is not defined in the
Act
but is described in section 21 of the
Old Age Security Regulations
, C.R.C., c. 1246 (the
Regulations
), the pertinent portions of which are also set out below.

Issues
[17]
The issues for determination are:
(a) the applicable standard of review; and
(b) whether the Review Tribunal's decision withstands review on the applicable standard.
The Standard of Review
[18]
Understandably, Ms. Kiefer did not make submissions on the applicable standard of review. The respondent's written submissions were filed prior to the release of the reasons in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . At the hearing, the respondent's counsel addressed the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case and proposed a standard of review of reasonableness.
[19] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> directs that where the jurisprudence has already determined in a satisfactory manner the degree of deference to be accorded with regard to a particular category of question, there is no need to engage in what is now referred to as a "standard of review analysis". Where this is not the case, a standard of review analysis is required. This analysis involves consideration of the factors that, pre- <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , were known as constituting the "pragmatic and functional analysis".
[20]
In
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Admin. L.R.(4th) 193 (F.C.), I conducted a pragmatic and functional analysis and determined that the applicable standard of review with respect to decisions of the Review Tribunal is reasonableness. At paragraphs 20-24, I stated:
"20. The powers of the Review Tribunal are not contained in the
Act
. Rather, as noted earlier, the Review Tribunal is established under section 82 of the
Canada Pension Plan
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-8 (the
CPP
). There is a privative clause of sorts, contained in subsection 84(1) of the
CPP
, the strength of which is bolstered by the fact that a decision of the Review Tribunal on an appeal under subsection 28(1) of the
Act
cannot be further appealed to a Pension Appeals Board (subsection 83(1) of the
CPP
). Subsection 84(1) of the
CPP
and subsection 28(3) of the
Act
do, however, explicitly recognize judicial review of a Review Tribunal's decision. Nonetheless, the presence of this privative clause does suggest deference to a Review Tribunal's decision determining an appeal under the
Act
.
"21. The issue of residency in relation to OAS eligibility is one that the Review Tribunal is regularly called upon to determine. The factual circumstances of each case call for findings that fall within its expertise and thus militate in favour of deference. In interpreting the definition of residency, however, the Court is equally or better positioned.
"22. The
Act
confers a benefit to certain individuals and establishes who is entitled to the receipt of benefits and to what extent. To that end, it involves the adjudication of an individual's rights. The conferment of benefits, however, is balanced with the interests of fairness and financial responsibility. The Minister is charged with the administration and integrity of the
Act
and the public interest in ensuring that applicants are not paid benefits to which they are not entitled. Thus, the
Act
provides for the adjudication of individual rights but is also polycentric in nature. This factor results in neither a high nor a low degree of deference.
"23. The nature of the question involves applying the correct legal test to various facts and is therefore one of mixed fact and law. It is more factually than legally driven (see:
Ding
, supra, and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.) wherein it was determined that residency is a question of fact to be determined in the particular circumstances). This factor favours more deference.
"24. Having regard to these factors, it is my view that the applicable standard of review is reasonableness. Consequently, I must have regard to the test set out by Mr. Justice Iacobocci in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) where he stated:
'A decision will be unreasonable only if there is no line of analysis within the given reasons that could reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the conclusion at which it arrived. If any of the reasons that are sufficient to support the conclusion are tenable in the sense that they can stand up to a somewhat probing examination, then the decision will not be unreasonable and a reviewing court must not interfere (see
Southam
, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 748 at para. 56). This means that a decision may satisfy the reasonableness standard if it is supported by a tenable explanation even if this explanation is not one that the reviewing court finds compelling (see
Southam
, at para. 79).'"
[21]
Other than the comments regarding the test for reasonableness (now overtaken by the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> test) if I were to engage in a standard of review analysis today, I would arrive at the same result. Consequently, I conclude that the applicable standard of review is reasonableness.
Analysis
[22]
To be eligible for a full pension, Ms. Keifer must come within the parameters of subparagraph 3(1)(b)(iii) of the
Act
. It provides:
"3(1)(b) every person who
. . . . .
(iii) has resided in Canada for the ten years immediately preceding the day on which that person's application is approved
or, if that person has not so resided, has, after attaining eighteen years of age, been present in Canada prior to those ten years for an aggregate period at least equal to three times the aggregate periods of absence from Canada during those ten years, and has resided in Canada for at least one year immediately preceding the day on which that person's application is approved; and
" (My emphasis)
[23]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), Mr. Justice Rouleau explained that the eligibility criteria in subparagraph 3(1)(b)(iii) contemplate two situations under which an applicant may qualify. First, an individual can establish that he or she has resided in Canada for the ten years immediately preceding the day on which the application is approved. Or, an individual can establish that he or she has been present in Canada, prior to the ten years, for the period specified therein, and has resided in Canada for at least one year immediately preceding the day on which the application is approved.
[24]
Ms. Keifer could not have qualified under the first of these options when she applied for her OAS pension. Her ten-year period would have run from 1978 to 1988. There is no debate that she was living in the United States in 1978, 1979 and 1980. Thus, her original application had to have been approved under the second of the two methods. That is, her 26 years spent in Nova Scotia from age 18 to 44 outweigh her collective absences during the 10-year period from 1978 to 1988. Because her Canadian residency portions were determined to be August 25, 1941 to April 1, 1967 and June 7, 1981 to August 25, 1988, she met the requirement of being resident (as the term is defined in the
Regulations
) for at least one year before her application was granted in 1988.
[25]
Ms. Kiefer claims that the Review Tribunal (in 2007) misapprehended the evidence and failed to consider relevant evidence. She submits that undue emphasis was placed upon the anonymous letter, which she suspects was the vindictive act of a disgruntled brother-in-law. It is unfortunate that Ms. Keifer failed to submit a similar letter, forwarded to the United States authorities, stating that Ms. Keifer resided in Canada rather than the United States. Such evidence may have significantly discredited the contents of the anonymous correspondence. However, the second letter was not before the Review Tribunal and must not factor into this analysis. There are other compelling reasons to set aside the Review Tribunal's decision.
[26]
The Review Tribunal, in the section of its reasons entitled "Background" provides an accurate recitation regarding much (not all) of the evidence that was tendered by Ms. Keifer to establish that she resided in Canada at the relevant time. However, it does not address a good deal of that evidence in the "Analysis" portion of its decision. Other probative evidence is not cited at all.
[27]
The deficiency in the Review Tribunal's reasons is the analysis proffered to support its conclusion. By virtue of subsection 82(11) of the
CPP
, the Review Tribunal is under a statutory duty to provide reasons for its decision. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> cautions that the concept of deference imports respect for the decision-making process of adjudicative bodies with regard to both the facts and the law. It requires a respectful attention to the reasons offered or which could be offered in support of a decision. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> also instructs that a court conducting a review for reasonableness "inquires into the qualities that make a decision reasonable, referring both to the
process of articulating the reasons
and to outcomes." Reasonableness is concerned mostly with the "existence of
justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process
". It is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are
defensible in respect of the facts and law
(My emphasis).
[28]
The respondent rightly notes that there is a presumption that a tribunal has considered all the evidence before it. To be sure, an administrative tribunal's reasons are not to be read hypercritically. However, much will depend on the significance of the evidence that is not mentioned. I regard it as settled law that a court will be reluctant to defer to a tribunal's decision where the tribunal's reasons consider in detail the evidence supporting its conclusions, but do not refer to important evidence pointing to a different conclusion:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.).
[29]
The respondent also contends that the Review Tribunal was cognizant of the proper legal test as demonstrated by its comments that regard must be had to all of the circumstances and not merely the intention of the appellant. I agree that the Review Tribunal recited the proper test. Whether or not it applied that test is another matter.
[30]
The Review Tribunal states, in relation to Ms. Keifer establishing her residence in Canada, that it accepts that she and her husband intended to retire in Nova Scotia. It then opines that the determination of residency must be "made having regard to all of the circumstances and not merely the intention of the appellant". I consider that statement to be an accurate representation of the law. Armed with that proposition, the Review Tribunal then determines, for reasons that are not apparent to me, that despite the fact that Mr. Keifer was required to be in Florida for health reasons, the choice to purchase the Florida property was with the intention of making it their permanent residence. Upon making this determination, the Review Tribunal then proceeds to characterize the time in Canada as "splitting" the time between the two countries.
[31]
The Review Tribunal states that while there is "some evidence" of Ms. Keifer having moved "some personal effects to Nova Scotia in 1983", it does not substantiate that she would be making her home in Nova Scotia. While I do not disagree, I find it anomalous that the tribunal did not take note that the Keifers' vehicle formed part of those personal effects, as evidenced by the Canada Customs invoice.
[32]
Mr. Keifer's landed immigrant status is treated as being offset by the fact that "in his mind" he considered himself to be a United States citizen. With respect, Mr. Keifer's mental state with respect to his loyalty and ties to his country are not material to Ms. Keifer's residency in Canada.
[33]
While I agree with the Review Tribunal that legal ownership of the Florida property is not significant for purposes of Ms. Keifer's appeal, the fact that the couple were "living together as a married couple" is not in dispute and adds nothing to the inquiry. They lived as a married couple both in Nova Scotia and in Florida.
[34]
Dr. Doucet's evidence, wherein he enumerates the various dates upon which he provided medical attention to either Mr. or Ms. Keifer is said to do no more than support Ms. Keifer's status as a "summer resident". Notably, several of the consultations included appointments in the spring and fall. Dr. Doucet also explained that the visit fees were paid by MSI (Nova Scotia Medical Services Insurance), available only to "residents of Nova Scotia". Further, he commented that he had made several house calls to Ms. Keifer's home in Summerville to oversee care for Mr. Keifer. He observed that the house was quite comfortable, was heated with both electric baseboard heating and a wood stove and was equipped for year-round occupation. Finally, he referred to the fact that the couple spent the "cold winter months in Florida because of Paul's poor health".
[35]
The Review Tribunal's final observation is that the evidence regarding the servicing of the Nova Scotia property does not indicate that Ms. Keifer actually made her home there. That is a legitimate observation. However, it also states that the "evidence of hydro and insurance services to the property
without further evidence
that the property in Nova Scotia was actually home for her does not substantiate her appeal". It is astonishing that the tribunal could make such a statement in the face of the evidence before it.
[36]
A review of the evidence that was before the Review Tribunal is useful. Clearly, the Keifers owned an apartment in Florida during the 1981-1988 period of time. It had been purchased in 1978. They also owned the property in Nova Scotia, which they purchased in 1981. Mere "ownership" per se, in my view, does not resolve the issue regarding which of the two countries was the one where Ms. Keifer "ordinarily lived".
[37]
The Review Tribunal accepted that Mr. Keifer had a bronchial illness and that his health could not handle the cold Canadian winters. There was evidence before the tribunal that Ms. Keifer was not choosing to spend her time in Florida merely because of the weather (as many Canadians do annually, without penalty). Rather, she felt obliged to attend to her husband's medical needs.
[38]
That is the extent of the evidence with respect to the Florida property.
[39]
In relation to indicia of residence in Nova Scotia, I have previously referred to some of that evidence. In addition, there was evidence regarding Ms. Keifer's membership in her church community, her membership in social groups and her participation in politics (she worked for the Liberal party, her name was on the electoral voters list, she voted). There was also evidence that: she qualified for a home improvement grant from the Nova Scotia government (specifically siding); she had a roadway licence from the Province of Nova Scotia; she had a Nova Scotia Driver's Licence which she claimed she obtained in 1984 when she surrendered her Florida licence; she filed tax returns; she purchased a burial plot and stone in Liverpool, Nova Scotia (and provided photographs of it).
[40]
I have previously noted that Ms. Keifer had MSI in Nova Scotia as well as Dr. Doucet's statement that such coverage was available only to residents of Nova Scotia. The Review Tribunal makes no reference to this evidence. As stated earlier, the tribunal does refer to the hydro, insurance and servicing arrangements for the Nova Scotia property during the relevant time, but it discounts that evidence.
[41]
Ms. Keifer also submitted the statements of friends (including the mayor of Liverpool), attesting to the periods of time when she lived in her Nova Scotia home (during the relevant time period), and she spoke of her inquiries to Canadian government officials in relation to her border crossings as well as her pension benefits. In this respect, I reject the respondent's submission that what Ms. Keifer was told for "immigration or tax purposes" does not have any bearing on her "old age security benefits". In my view, when citizens make inquiries of government officials, Canada speaks with one voice, not several.
[42]
I fully appreciate and accept the respondent's position that there is a presumption that a tribunal has considered all of the evidence before it, in the absence of some contrary indication. It appears self-evident to me that there is such a contrary indication in this case. There is no comparative analysis of the evidence in relation to Ms. Keifer's residence in Florida and her residence in Nova Scotia. I also appreciate that it is not for the court to substitute its opinion for that of the Review Tribunal, even if the court would have reached a different conclusion.
[43]
That said, in view of the Review Tribunal's reliance on the concept of "intention" regarding Florida and its failure to refer to evidence that is central to the issue before it, I conclude that the reasons of the Review Tribunal lack justification, transparency and intelligibility. The process of articulating reasons that provide justification, transparency and intelligibility for a conclusion is important because it allows for a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.
[44]
The reasons must demonstrate that the submissions were considered and provide a basis for understanding why those submissions were rejected. A conclusion will not be rational or defensible if the tribunal has failed to carry out the proper analysis:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The reasons and, more specifically, the analysis in this matter fall short of that test.
[45]
I add, for completeness, that the evidence in the record regarding the fact that Ms. Keifer sold her Nova Scotia home in 1997 and that she informed the department in 1999, of her own volition, that she was residing in the United States at that time is irrelevant to the inquiry. It is concerned with the time period in the 1980s.
[46]
The application for judicial review will be allowed and the matter will be remitted for determination. The applicant, as a self-represented litigant, is entitled to reimbursement of her reasonable disbursements.
