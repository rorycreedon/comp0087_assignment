II. Facts
[2]
On March 14, 1994, the Sioux Valley Indian Band No. 290 (the "Band") held an election for Band Chief and Band Council. Elections for the council of the band may be governed by either the provisions of the
Indian Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5, (the "
Act
") or by band custom, pursuant to ss. 2(1) and 74 of the
Act
. Section 2(1) of the
Act
defines council of the band as follows:
"'council of the band' means
(a) in the case of a band to which s. 74 applies, the council established
pursuant to that section
,
(b) in the case of a band to which s. 74 does not apply, the council chosen
according to the custom of the band
, or, where there is no council, the chief of the band chosen according to the custom of the band;" (emphasis added)
Section 74(1) of the
Act
reads as follows:
"74(1) Whenever he deems it advisable for the good government of a band, the Minister may declare by order that after a day to be named therein the council of the band, consisting of a chief and councillors, shall be selected by elections to be held in accordance with this Act."
[3]
Prior to March 14, 1994, pursuant to Order-in-Council P.C. 4283, dated October 15, 1952, and the
Indian Band Council Election Order
of the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs (the "Minister"), dated December 14, 1989, s. 74 of the
Act
applied to the Band, and thus per s. 2(1) of the
Act
, Band election procedures were governed by the provisions of the
Indian Act
. However, for approximately 20-24 months prior to the March 14, 1994, elections, the Band considered reverting to a set of election procedures based on Band custom. [see footnote 1]
[4]
In accordance with the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs' (the "Department") policy with respect to reversion to a custom system of elections, a plebiscite was held on June 28, 1993, for the purpose of demonstrating the support of the Band membership for a repeal of the s. 74 ministerial order and for an election system to be subsequently employed. A majority of voters in that plebiscite voted in favour of the proposal. However, as fewer than a majority of the total eligible voters voted in the first plebiscite, a second plebiscite was held on July 30, 1993. Again, the majority of voters were in favour of the proposal. Notice of both plebiscites was posted at various locations throughout the Reserve. Only those Band members who resided on the Reserve were permitted to vote in the plebiscites. [see footnote 2]
[5]
In an effort to reduce the Band's custom into a recognizable form, the
Sioux Valley Dakota Oyate Custom Election Code
(the "
Code
") was drafted. The applicant has included a copy of the final version of the
Code
in his affidavit [see footnote 3]; it is dated July, 1993. In addition to the
Code
, the
Sioux Valley Dakota Oyate Custom Elections Regulations
(the "
Regulations
") were developed, a copy of which is also included in the applicant's affidavit, and it is dated February 8, 1994. [see footnote 4] A third document was also drafted, entitled the
Sioux Valley Dakota Oyate Code of Ethics
(the "
Code of Ethics
"), a copy of which is found in the applicant's affidavit and is also dated February 8, 1994. [see footnote 5]
[6]
By a letter dated February 3, 1994, Wendy Porteous of the Department, recommended to the Deputy Minister that the s. 74 ministerial order be repealed. By an order dated February 7, 1994, the Deputy Minister, Dan Goodleaf, revoked the ministerial order of December 14, 1989, insofar as it applied to the Sioux Valley Band, and declared that on and after March 14, 1994, the council of the Band would be selected in accordance with the custom of the Band. [see footnote 6]
[7]
On February 28, 1994, the Band held a nomination meeting, and the applicant and the respondent Hall were nominated for the office of Band Chief. No person objected to the nomination of the respondent Hall for the office of Chief at this nomination meeting and at no time prior to the election. [see footnote 7] On March 14, 1994, elections were held for the positions of Band Chief and for five Band Councillors. The respondent Hall was elected to the office of Band Chief [see footnote 8], a position the applicant had held for the previous eight years. [see footnote 9]
[8]
Following the election, on March 18, 1994, the applicant appealed the election of the respondent Hall, pursuant to s. 15.1 of the
Code
, on the basis that he had not met the residency requirement set out in the
Code
and
Regulations
. [see footnote 10] Section 7 of the
Code
requires candidates for Band Council to have resided on the Reserve for the past 12 months prior to the election. Section 16(4) of the
Regulations
provides for an interpretation of the words "resided on the Reserve" in the
Code
. [see footnote 11] An Election Appeals Board was established pursuant to the provisions of the
Code
, and on or about March 26, 1994, the Board ordered that a new general election be held. Pursuant to s. 2(1) of the
Regulations
, only the Itancan, defined as the Chief and Council, is empowered to call an election. However, the respondent Hall has refused to step down as Chief and the respondent Band Council has refused to call a new election.
[9]
The respondent Hall deposed in his affidavit, that on March 23, 1994, upon learning that the applicant was questioning his eligibility to stand for the office of Chief, he sought legal advice from his current legal counsel, Mr. Sheldon. In addition, he consulted the Council of Elders regarding his eligibility as a candidate and whether he should be a candidate in a new election. The Elders endorsed the legal opinion given to him, and advised against submission to a new election. A majority of the duly elected Band Council gave similar advice. Based on these conversations, the respondent Hall deposed that he concluded there was negligible support for a new election or for the
Code
. [see footnote 12]
[10]
On October 14, 1994, the applicant filed an Originating Notice of Motion with this court, thereby commencing this application for judicial review. [see footnote 13] On February 7, 1995, the applicant filed an Amended Originating Notice of Motion. [see footnote 14]
III. Issues
1. Is the applicant out of time in bringing this application by virtue of subss. 18(3) and 18.1(2) of the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7?
2. Should the court declare that the
Sioux Valley Dakota Oyate Custom Election Code
was in force on March 14, 1994?
3. Should the court declare that the
Sioux Valley Dakota Oyate Custom Elections Regulations
were in force on March 14, 1994?
4. Should the respondent Hall be removed from the office of the Chief of the Sioux Valley Indian Band by the issuance of a writ of quo warranto?
5. Should the respondent Band Council be required to hold a new general election for the offices of Band Chief and Councillors by the issuance of a writ of mandamus?
6. Should the respondent Hall be prevented from running as a candidate in a new election for the office of Band Chief by the issuance of an injunction?
IV. Analysis
[11]
Prior to embarking on an analysis of the issues before the court, the position of two of the respondents, those being Mr. Ironman and Mr. Pratt, must be clarified. The respondents Ironman and Pratt were represented at the hearing by Mr. Lee, whereas the remaining respondents, were represented by Mr. Sheldon, Q.C. The respondents Ironman and Pratt, through their counsel Mr. Lee, indicated at the hearing that they agreed with the applicant with respect to items 1, 2, 3 and 4 of his Amended Originating Notice of Motion, but disagreed with item 6, being the injunction sought to prevent the respondent Hall from running as a candidate, should the determination of this application result in a new election. This was the extent of the respondents Ironman and Pratt's submissions.
[12]
In the analysis below, any reference to the "respondents" is intended as a reference to the respondents other than respondents Ironman and Pratt.
1. Is The Applicant Out Of Time
In Bringing This Application
By Virtue Of SS. 18(3) And 18.1(2)
Of The Federal Court Act,
R.S.C. 1985, C. F-7?
[13]
As a preliminary issue, the respondents have submitted that the applicant is out of time in bringing this application by virtue of ss. 18(3) and 18.1(2) of the
Federal Court Act
. These sections, as they were at the material time, read as follows:
"18(1) Subject to s. 28, the Trial Division has exclusive original jurisdiction
(a) to issue an injunction, writ of certiorari, writ of prohibition, writ of mandamus or writ of quo warranto, or grant declaratory relief, against any federal board, commission or other tribunal; and
(b) to hear and determine any application or other proceeding for relief in the nature of relief contemplated by paragraph (a), including any proceeding brought against the Attorney General of Canada, to obtain relief against a federal board, commission or other tribunal.
"(2) The Trial Division has exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine every application for a writ of 'habeas corpus ad subjiciendum', writ of certiorari, writ of prohibition or writ of mandamus in relation to any member of the Canadian Forces serving outside Canada.
"(3) The remedies provided for in subss. (1) and (2) may be obtained only on an application for judicial review made under s. 18.1.
"18.1(1) An application for judicial review may be made by the Attorney General of Canada or by anyone directly affected by the matter in respect of which relief is sought.
"(2) An application for judicial review in respect of a decision or order of a federal board, commission or other tribunal shall be made within 30 days after the time the decision or order was first communicated by the federal board, commission or other tribunal to the office of the Deputy Attorney General of Canada or to the party directly affected thereby, or within such further time as a judge of the Trial Division may, either before or after the expiration of those 30 days, fix or allow."
[14]
Section 18.1(2) requires that an application for judicial review in respect of a decision or order of a federal board, commission or other tribunal be made within 30 days after the time the decision or order is first communicated by the federal board to the party directly affected thereby.
[15]
The applicant made two submissions. Firstly, the applicant submitted that with respect to the remedy of quo warranto, it is apparent from the Federal Court decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) [hereinafter
Jock
], that the 30 day limitation period is inapplicable. The
Jock
decision is a 1991 decision of this court that deals with facts similar to those in the case at bar. In
Jock
Justice Teitelbaum declined to make an order in the nature of quo warranto. The applicant submitted that there was no suggestion in the
Jock
decision that one would have to be concerned with the 30 day limitation in s. 18.1(2). Applicant's counsel thus submitted that quo warranto is available under s. 18, arguably independent of the constraints of s. 18.1.
[16]
This argument of the applicant is flawed in two respects. Firstly, when the
Jock
decision was rendered, in 1991, s. 18.1 was not even in existence; the section came into force on February 1, 1992. Prior to this, the
Act
did not impose a limitation period in relation to judicial review applications before the Trial Division. Secondly, pursuant to s. 18(3), the remedy of quo warranto may only be obtained by an application for judicial review brought under s. 18.1. Accordingly, it cannot be said that quo warranto is available under s. 18, independent of the constraints of s. 18.1, as was submitted by the applicant.
[17]
The applicant further submitted that as the application is not derived from a decision or order of a federal board, commission or tribunal, but rather stems from the failure of the respondents to abide by the
Code
, ss. 18(3) and 18.1(2) do not come into play. The applicant has not brought this application in order to quash a decision or order of a federal board, but rather seeks remedies including an order in the nature of mandamus, to compel a federal board to fulfil a duty.
[18]
The respondents have conceded that in relation to the declaratory and injunctive relief sought, the limitation provision is not applicable. However, the respondents do not extend this concession to relief in the nature of quo warranto or mandamus. The respondents submitted that the Chief and Band Council made the
decision
not to adhere to the order of the Election Appeal Board to call a new general election, and accordingly there is indeed a decision of a federal board. The applicant's reply to this submission is that the decision was to ignore a decision, the order of the Election Appeal Board, and this is not the sort of decision contemplated by s. 18.1.
[19]
As a result of the respondents' concession with respect to the declaratory relief sought, and the relief I have decided to order in this matter, the issue of the limitation provision in relation to a writ of quo warranto or a writ of mandamus need not be determined.
[20]
The respondents also submitted, in their Memorandum of Argument, that the sole ground for relief sought was a technical irregularity, and therefore under s. 18.1(5) of the
Federal Court Act
, the court may refuse the relief if it finds that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred. The respondents did not make submissions in this regard at the hearing. In my view, this argument has no merit. The analysis of the issues below establishes that the grounds upon which this application is based go beyond a "defect in form or a technical irregularity" as those expressions are employed in subs. 18.1(5).
2. Should The Court Declare That
The Sioux Valley Dakota Oyate Custom
Election Code Was In Force
On March 14, 1994?
[21]
The determination of several sub-issues is necessary in order to decide whether the court should make such a declaration.
i. Does The Court Have Jurisdiction
To Grant A Declaration?
[22]
As a preliminary issue, the applicant made submissions in relation to the court's jurisdiction to grant a declaration in an application for judicial review. The respondents have not challenged the court's jurisdiction: both parties request the court issue a declaration as to whether or not the
Code
was in force at the material time. I am satisfied the court does have jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief pursuant to an application for judicial review by virtue of s. 18(1)(a) and s. 18(3) of the
Federal Court Act
, supra.
ii. Are Band Council Elections
Governed By The Indian Act
Or Band Custom?
[23]
Prior to March 14, 1994, Band election procedures were governed by the provisions of the
Indian Act
, pursuant to Order-in-Council P.C. 4283, dated October 15, 1952, and the Indian Band Council Election Order of the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs, dated December 14, 1989. There is no dispute between the parties that the ministerial order pursuant to s. 74(1) was revoked by an order of the Deputy Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs, dated February 7, 1994. [see footnote 15] Thereafter, the Band's Council was defined by the provisions of part (b) of the definition of "council of a band" found in s. 2 of the
Indian Act
and was, therefore to be chosen according to the custom of the band.
[24]
Accordingly, the election for Band Council here in issue, namely the election of March 14, 1994, was to have been conducted pursuant to Band custom.
iii. Does The Code Reflect The Band's
Custom In Relation To The Selection
Of The Band's Council?
[25]
I agree with the respondents' submission that the
Code
and
Regulations
are "nothing more than an attempt to put down in some kind of recognizable and written form the electoral practices of this particular Band". [see footnote 16] There is no requirement under the
Indian Act
that a Band reduce to writing its custom with respect to the selection of the Band's Council. By way of example, if the Band's custom was simply that the eldest child of a Chief or Councillor inherited the position upon the Chief or Councillor's death, it may not be necessary to write this custom into a code or bylaw: such a custom could easily be passed from generation to generation by word-of-mouth. However, the custom of the Band in the case at bar is not so simple, and accordingly the Band has seen fit to formulate a written
Code
and
Regulations
setting out the Band's custom for choosing the Band's Council. The dispute that has arisen is whether or not the
Code
and
Regulations
so developed do indeed reflect the custom of the Band.
[26]
Justice Strayer in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), was also asked to determine the validity of rules adopted to govern a band's election procedure, which was to be in accordance with the band's custom. His Lordship noted that the
Indian Act
provided "no guidance as to how that custom is to be identified". [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 117] He stated the following at pp. 117 and 118:
"
Unless otherwise defined in respect of a particular band, 'custom' must I think include practices for the choice of a council which are generally acceptable to members of the band, upon which there is a broad consensus.
With a newly re-established band whose circumstances are vastly different (e.g. the majority not being resident on the reserve) from those of the band dissolved some 90 years earlier, it is not surprising that innovative measures would have to be taken to establish a contemporary 'custom'. The real question as to the validity of the new constitution then seems to be one of political, not legal, legitimacy: is the constitution based on a majority consensus of those who, on the existing evidence, appear to be members of the band? This is a question which a court should not seek to answer in the absence of some discernable legal criteria which it can apply. While there might be some other basis for judicial supervision if there were clear evidence of fraud or other acts on the part of the defendants which could clearly not be authorized by the
Indian Act
, there is no evidence of any such activities before me." (emphasis added) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 117-118]
[27]
In the words of Justice Strayer, a band's custom must "include practices for the choice of a council which are generally acceptable to members of the band, upon which there is a broad consensus". I agree with this characterization of a band's custom. However, determining what is generally acceptable to members of the band gives rise to difficulties, as is exemplified by this litigation. Justice Strayer further stated the validity of the constitution in that case was a question of political legitimacy, and was a question the court should not seek to answer in the absence of some "discernible legal criteria".
[28]
The respondents submitted that the objective legal criteria sought by Justice Strayer could be found in s. 2(3)(a) of the
Indian Act
. This section reads as follows:
"2(3) Unless the context otherwise requires or this Act otherwise provides,
(a) a power conferred on a band shall be deemed not to be exercised unless it is exercised pursuant to the consent of a majority of the electors of the band; and ..."
[29]
The respondents submitted that it is the Band that has the power to determine what the constitution, or electoral procedures, of the Band are, and that this power must be exercised in accordance with s. 2(3)(a), as set out, supra. I agree that it is the Band itself, not the Band Council, that has the power to determine what constitutes the Band's custom. However, I disagree with the respondents' submission that this is a "power conferred on a band" as is contemplated by s. 2(3)(a) of the
Indian Act
.
[30]
Section 2(1) of the
Indian Act
defines "council of the band", as meaning:
"(a) in the case of a band to which s. 74 applies, the council established pursuant to that section;
"(b) in the case of a band to which s. 74 does not apply, the council chosen according to the custom of the band, or, where there is no council, the chief of the band chosen according to the custom of the band;"
[31]
It seems clear that this is a "definition" provision rather than an "empowering" provision. It simply states that a council of a band is either a council chosen according to the Band's custom or, if a ministerial order is in effect pursuant to s. 74(1) of the
Act
, it is a council that has been elected in accordance with the
Indian Act
. It does not confer a power upon a Band to develop a custom for selecting its council. Rather, it recognizes that an Indian Band has customs, developed over decades if not centuries, which may include a custom for selecting the Band's Chief and Councillors. The definition of "council of a band" acknowledges that prior to the enactment of the
Indian Act
in 1951, Indian Bands had their own methods for selecting the Band Council. The power or ability to continue choosing the Band Council in the customary manner is left intact by the
Indian Act
, except in those cases where the power is removed from the Band by a ministerial order under s. 74(1) of the
Act
.
[32]
Accordingly, I do not think that the power of the Band to choose its council in a customary manner is a "power conferred on the Band" as is contemplated by s. 2(3)(a) of the
Indian Act
. Rather it is an inherent power of the Band; it is a power the Band has always had, which the
Indian Act
only interferes with in limited circumstances, as provided for under s. 74 of the
Act
. Thus, in my view the Band may exercise this inherent power unrestrained by s. 2(3)(a) of the
Indian Act
.
[33]
Returning to Justice Strayer's definition of "custom", the question remains as to whether the
Code
reflects the Band's custom: does it enunciate practices that are generally acceptable to members of the band and upon which there is a broad consensus?
Revocation Of The S. 74
Ministerial Order
[34]
The applicant provided evidence to support his submission that the
Code
received Band approval. As was discussed above, it is not disputed that the ministerial order that brought the Band Council elections under the governance of the
Indian Act
, was revoked in February of 1994. Attached as an exhibit to the Affidavit of Robert Bone, filed on behalf of the applicant, is a copy of the policy and procedures to be followed by the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs, for the purpose of recommending to the Minister that an order pursuant to s. 74 be repealed. Paragraph 2 of the policy states:
"Where a band wishes to have a s. 74 order repealed, the department must ensure that the band has, or will have, a system in place which is supported by the band membership and which protects the rights of the individual band members."
The policy further states that evidence of band membership support may be obtained at a public band meeting, by petition, by plebiscite or by other means within the custom of the Band.
[35]
In the case at bar, two plebiscites were held on the Band's reserve, for the purpose of fulfilling this requirement. The Department's policy sets out the procedure to be followed by a band that chooses to demonstrate the support of its membership in this manner. The procedure provided that if those who voted in favour of the proposed repeal and alternate system did not constitute a simple majority of all eligible voters, that a second plebiscite must be held within one month, at which only the support of a simple majority of those who voted was necessary.
[36]
It is not disputed that the first plebiscite was held on June 28, 1993. The results of the plebiscite were: 128 in favour and 71 against. [see footnote 17] As the number of votes in favour did not constitute a majority of the total number of eligible voters, a second plebiscite was held on July 30, 1993, the results of which were: 13 in favour; two against; and one spoiled ballot. [see footnote 18] Thus, since a simple majority of the total number of votes cast at the second plebiscite was in favour, the Department's policy enunciated, supra, was complied with.
[37]
There was a minor infraction of the Department's procedure, namely, that the second plebiscite was to be held within one month of the first plebiscite. However, it was in fact held two days later, on July 30, 1993. I am of the view this minor deviation from the policy is inconsequential.
[38]
However, there is an important difficulty in relation to the plebiscite: neither party adduced evidence as to what question was put to the voters in either of these plebiscites. Incredibly, neither party, that is neither the person who was Band Chief at the time of the plebiscites, the applicant Robert Bone, or the people who presently hold the positions of Band Chief and Councillors, the respondents, presented affidavit evidence as to the content of the plebiscite question. Unfortunately, absence of this evidence makes disposition of this matter more difficult.
[39]
In the absence of evidence of the question posed upon the plebiscite ballots, the results of the plebiscite have limited use. At most, the court could infer that as the plebiscites were held for the purpose of meeting the Department's criteria for recommending the repeal of a s. 74 order, and since the order was in fact ultimately repealed, the Department's requirements must have been satisfied. If the court chooses to draw this inference, then the corollary is that the plebiscite indicated support by the band membership of a repeal of s. 74
and
of the election system to be employed thereafter.
[40]
It is appropriate at this time to deal with the respondent's submissions regarding the restriction of the plebiscite to those Band members who were resident on the Reserve. The respondents submitted that once the Band decided to demonstrate support of the Band membership via a plebiscite, that s. 2(3) of the
Indian Act
required the consent of a majority of the electors of the Band, and that the definition of elector in the
Indian Act
does not contain a residency requirement. Firstly, as was discussed above, s. 2(3) of the
Act
has no relevance to these proceedings. However, the respondents second submission warrants discussion.
[41]
The Department's policy that the Band was seeking to comply with in holding the plebiscites stated that Band electors, as defined in the
Indian Act
, were eligible to vote. The respondents submitted that the definition of elector in the
Act
did not contain a residency requirement. The applicant responded to this submission by contending that the law in question in 1993 did indeed contain a residency requirement. This issue can be resolved simply by recourse to the applicable statute at the material time.
[42]
Section 2 of the
Indian Act
, in 1993, defined elector as follows:
"'elector' means a person who
(a) is registered on a Band List,
(b) is of the full age of 18 years, and
(c) is not disqualified from voting at band elections;"
[43]
Thus, the definition of "elector" in the
Act
did not contain a requirement the elector be resident on the Reserve. However, with respect to specific types of votes, per part (c) of the definition, an elector may be disqualified from voting by a provision of the
Act
. For example, if the vote in question was an election for the office of Chief or Councillor, held pursuant to the
Indian Act
, then per s. 77(1) of the
Act
, as it was in 1993, an elector was disqualified from voting unless he/she was ordinarily resident on the Reserve. [see footnote 19] The
Indian Band Election Regulations
further defined "ordinarily resident" for the purposes of the Band Council elections. Justice Strayer, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), declared s. 77(1) of the
Indian Act
to be in contravention of s. 15 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
[see footnote 20], in a decision dated September 9, 1993. However, Justice Strayer suspended operation of his decision until July 1, 1994, to allow Parliament time to consider amending the
Act
. The applicant's counsel in the case at bar correctly submitted in argument that at the material time, June and July of 1993, s. 77(1) was in effect, as this was prior to Justice Strayer's decision.
[44]
However, s. 77(1) has no relevance to these proceedings. The votes in question, in the plebiscites of June and July, 1993, were not elections as contemplated by s. 77 of the
Indian Act
: they were not elections for the office of Chief and/or Councillors. The votes in question were plebiscites held to comply with the Department's policy in relation to the revocation of a s. 74 ministerial order. The said policy incorporated the definition of elector as found in the
Indian Act
, which is set out above. This definition does not contain a residency requirement. It does provide for the disqualification of a potential elector in part (c) of the definition. And, as was discussed above, prior to the decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , if the election were for Chief or Councillor, an elector was disqualified if he/she did not reside on the Reserve. However, the plebiscites in question were not such elections. Furthermore, there was no provision in the
Act
that disqualified electors for any reason, with respect to a plebiscite. Therefore, in my view, it follows that if a Band member had met the first two requirements of the definition, that is he/she was registered on the Band List and was 18 years of age or older, then he/she was an eligible elector according to this definition, and accordingly should have had the opportunity to vote in the plebiscites held in pursuance of the Department's policy. However, this was not the case. Nonresident Band members were not considered eligible voters and were not permitted the opportunity to vote in the plebiscites. In spite of this apparent deviation from the Department's policy, on the basis of the plebiscite results, the Department did recommend to the Minister that the s. 74 order be repealed.
[45]
Thus, the respondents were correct in submitting that nonresident Band members should have been given the opportunity to vote in the plebiscites.
[46]
What is the significance of this noncompliance with the Department's policy? In my view, it has no effect on the validity of the Deputy Minister's order repealing the s. 74 order. A ministerial order is in the discretion of the Minister: this policy was merely directory, not mandatory. However, I do think it weakens the weight to be accorded the inference that the Department's requirements were satisfied and thus there was evidence of Band membership support of the electoral system to be employed following revocation of the s. 74 order.
Draft Code In Existence
At Time Of Plebiscites
[47]
The next question for consideration is the following: what system was proposed at the time of the plebiscites? The respondent Hall deposed in his affidavit that at the time of the first plebiscite, there was a draft version of the
Code
in existence, and it was available to interested voters. [see footnote 21] Attached as an exhibit to his affidavit is a copy of the draft version of the
Code
. [see footnote 22] The applicant attached the final version of the
Code
as an exhibit to his affidavit [see footnote 23], but did not lead evidence as to the draft version of the
Code
available at the time of the plebiscites.
[48]
I have compared the draft version of the
Code
said by the respondent Hall to have been available at the time of the plebiscites, to the final version of the
Code
. There are indeed differences between the draft version and the final version, some of which are relatively minor, and some of which are quite significant. One significant difference, is the inclusion in the draft version of six provisions regarding conflict of interest. [see footnote 24] These were removed from the final version, and instead form the substance of the third document, entitled
Code of Ethics
. [see footnote 25]
[49]
The second major difference between the two versions is of particular relevance to these proceedings. The final version of the
Code
contains the provision, in paragraph 7, that restricts eligible candidates for Chief or Councillor to members who are 18 years of age or over and have resided on the Reserve for the past 12 months, prior to the election date. This is the provision that the applicant relies upon for his assertion that the respondent Hall was ineligible to run for the office of Chief. However, this very provision is
not
contained in the draft version, which the respondents submitted was the version available to voters at the time of the plebiscites. In fact, the draft version does not contain any such residency requirement.
[50]
The draft version contained in Exhibit B has a line at the bottom of each page which reads: "3rd drft-28-06-93mr". This suggests it is the third draft version, and is dated June 28, 1993. That was the date of the first plebiscite. However, also included in Exhibit B are two pages entitled "Sioux Valley Dakota Oyate Custom Election Code Summary", which contain a line at the bottom of each page which reads "25 June 1993 MR". These two pages purport to summarize the election code, and they do include a paragraph setting out the residency requirement. Although this document appears to pre-date the "third draft version" of the
Code
, the version this document claims to summarize apparently did contain the residency requirement. These two documents together constitute Exhibit B of the respondent Hall's affidavit.
[51]
In addition, the alleged final version of the
Code
, contained in Exhibit G of the applicant's affidavit, is dated July, 1993. This suggests that this version, which contains the residency clause, was in existence at least prior to the second plebiscite.
[52]
Furthermore, the respondents have not submitted that the draft version that was available at the time of the plebiscites did not contain the residency clause.
[53]
Therefore, in my view it can not now be said with certainty that the draft version of the
Code
available to Band members at the time of the plebiscites is the version contained in Exhibit B of the respondent Hall's affidavit. It seems to me that the only conclusion the court can draw from this evidence
is that there is no clear evidence
establishing which draft version of the
Code
was available to voters at the time of the plebiscite, and whether or not it contained the residency clause.
The Conduct Of The
March 14, 1994 Election
[54]
The next event that is relevant to the applicant's submission that the
Code
reflects the Band's custom is the March 14, 1994, election itself. It is not disputed that the election was held in accordance with the
Code
, and following the election the Election Appeal Board was appointed in accordance with the
Code
and adjudicated the applicant's appeal in a manner consistent with the
Code
. In fact, everything seemed to transpire in accordance with the
Code
until the Elections Appeal Board rendered its order, at which time the respondents refused to comply with the order.
[55]
The respondents' Counsel submitted in argument that in order for a band to elect a Council, they do not need a written constitution. He further submitted that the method of obtaining a Council could be anything that has the force of custom within the band. As an example, he submitted a band may have an unwritten custom that the Chief is to be the fastest runner in the band. [see footnote 26]
[56]
I agree with the respondents' Counsel, as noted, supra, that the custom of the Band does not necessarily have to be written into a Code or Bylaws. The respondents' Counsel takes the position that the March 14, 1994, election was not to have been conducted in accordance with the
Indian Act
, because the s. 74 order was repealed, and that it was not to have been conducted in accordance with the
Code
, as this
Code
does not reflect the Band's custom. Accordingly, the respondents' counsel submitted that at the time of the March 14, 1994, election, there was no legally adopted constitution governing Band Council elections. [see footnote 27] However, the respondents' continue to maintain that they are a legally constituted Band council on the basis that they were "
elected properly by a majority of the voters in accordance with some of the customs albeit unwritten
" (emphasis added). [see footnote 28] The respondents' had to make this assertion; otherwise, there is no legal basis for the respondents' holding office as Band Council. However, if the court accepts this assertion of the respondents, and then takes it one step further, the result is in fact detrimental to the respondents.
[57]
The respondents' position is that the March 14, 1994, election was held in accordance with Band custom. However, the Band's custom was not reflected in the
Code
. Rather, the respondents submitted that the Band Council was elected in accordance with the unwritten custom of the Band. If that proposition is accepted, then I am of the view that such a circumstance in fact supports the applicant's submission that the
Code
reflects the Band's custom. That is, if one accepts that the election proceeded in a manner consistent with the Band's unwritten custom, then since this unwritten custom mirrored the alleged written custom (the
Code
), it follows that the
Code
sets out in writing the custom of the Band. I am of the view that if one accepts the first proposition, it is also necessary to accept the second proposition, namely, that the
Code
reflects the Band's custom.
[58]
Accordingly, in my view the respondents' find themselves in a difficult position. They have conceded that the
Indian Act
no longer governs the Band Council elections, and they have attacked the validity of the
Code
. As a result, they have taken the position that the legal basis for their election may be found in the unwritten custom of the Band, which they submit the election complied with. There are two difficulties with this argument. The first difficulty is the one referred to supra: if the election was consistent with the
Code
and was also consistent with the unwritten custom, then the
Code
and custom must be one and the same.
[59]
The second difficulty with the respondents' contention arises from their earlier submission that holding an election pursuant to Band custom is a power conferred on the Band, and thus must be exercised in accordance with s. 2(3) of the
Indian Act
, which requires support of a majority of the Band members. Although I have rejected this argument, for reasons given supra, that does not alter the fact that it is the respondents' position. If the Band is to exercise this "conferred power" by developing a written
Code
encompassing the Band's custom, which the respondent's have submitted would require the support of a majority of the Band's membership, it then follows that if the Band chooses to exercise this "conferred power" by using unwritten customs to conduct an election, this exercise of power would similarly require the support of a majority of the Band's membership. To use the respondents' counsel's own example, if the unwritten custom of the Band was to have the fastest runner as Band Chief, then before the Band exercised its "conferred power" to hold a race to determine who the fastest runner was, the Band would require support of the Band membership to exercise the power in this manner.
[60]
In summary, if s. 2(3) applies in this context, which I concluded, supra, it does not, then not only would it apply when the Band attempts to embody the custom in a written document, but it would apply to
any
exercise of the power. Thus, the respondents' find themselves in a difficult position. Their reasoning, when consistently applied, does not support their submissions.
[61]
Despite all of the difficulties cited supra, an election was held on March 14, 1994, and as a result the respondents attained their positions as Chief and Band Council. In my view, there are three possible conclusions to be drawn concerning this election:
1. The
Code
is valid, and accordingly the election had a legal basis and the results stand, subject to the ruling of the Elections Appeal Board.
2. The
Code
is invalid, however the election was conducted according to unwritten Band custom and thus had a legal basis and, accordingly, the results thereof should prevail.
3. The
Code
is invalid, and since there is no evidence that the election was conducted according to unwritten Band custom, the election had no legal basis and accordingly the results are null and void.
[62]
In my view, the third option is the least desirable. This choice leaves the Band in a serious quandary. Firstly, it leaves the Band without a Band Council. Secondly, it leaves the Band without a generally accepted Band custom as to how a new Band Council ought to be selected. The result of this option would likely be chaotic.
[63]
I am of the view, for reasons stated earlier, that the second option is not sound in law. There is no reason for this court to accept that the election proceeded according to unwritten Band custom, when the respondents have failed to produce any evidence in support of this submission, i.e. they have not produced evidence of what, in their view, is the Band's custom in relation to the selection of the Band Council.
[64]
There remains the first option which, in my view, is the most desirable. However, the evidence summarized above amounts to no more than a weak inference that the
Code
received the support of the Band membership. I think the answer is to be found in the conduct of the Band in relation to the March 14, 1994, election and the events that followed. The Band conducted the nomination proceedings, the election and the subsequent election appeal, all in accordance with the
Code
. According to the Affidavit of the respondent Hall, there were 478 votes cast for the election of the Band Chief. Although neither party led evidence as to the total number of eligible voters at the time of the election, the respondent Hall deposed that at the time of the plebiscites there were 964 Band members of voting age, including nonresidents. Thus, it can be said that approximately 50% of the eligible voters participated in the March 14, 1994, election. There is no evidence that at any time before or during the election any Band member objected to the manner in which the election by Band custom was proceeding. In my view, the conduct of the Band in acquiescing in the use of the
Code
, is sufficient evidence to satisfy the requirement of Justice Strayer, as set out in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, that it was "generally acceptable to members of the band, upon which there is a broad consensus", and therefore reflects the Band's custom.
[65]
Accordingly, I declare that the
Code
was in force as of March 14, 1994.
3. Should The Court Declare
That The Sioux Valley Dakota
Oyate Custom Elections Regulations
Were In Force On March 14, 1994?
[66]
The next issue to be determined is the validity of the
Regulations
, purportedly enacted in pursuance of the
Code
. The validity of the
Regulations
is significant to the outcome of this application for two reasons.
[67]
Firstly, although it is the
Code
that contains the residency requirement in relation to a candidate for the office of Band Chief, it is the
Regulations
that contain the stringent definition of the words "resided on the Reserve". The respondent Hall has conceded that if the
Regulations
are found to be valid, that he does not meet the residency requirement, as it is defined in the
Regulations
. [see footnote 29] However, the respondent Hall further submitted that if the court determined that the
Code
was valid, but the
Regulations
were invalid, then he maintained his position that he
does
meet the residency requirement, as articulated in the
Code
alone.
[68]
Secondly, although the
Code
provides for the creation of an Elections Appeal Board, it is the
Regulations
that confer powers upon this Board. Thus, in the absence of these
Regulations
, the Elections Appeal Board has limited power.
[69]
Section 19 of the
Code
empowers the Band Council to develop regulations to give effect to the
Code
. This section reads as follows:
"19. The Council of the Sioux Valley Dakota Oyate will, in advance of the March 1994 election,
develop and submit to the community for approval, regulations to give effect to this Code
and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, will develop regulations with respect to:
(a) nomination procedures,
(b) appointment and tasks of electoral officers,
(c) election procedures,
(d) appointment and tasks of election appeal board members, and
(e) appeal procedures." (Emphasis added) [see footnote 30]
The
Regulations
, included in Exhibit G of the applicant's affidavit, are dated February 8, 1994. There has been no evidence led to rebut the inference that these
Regulations
were not in existence, in their present form, prior to that date. Accordingly, they certainly were not available to voters at the time of the plebiscites. The reason I draw attention to this fact arises from the wording of the above enabling provision. It states that the Council was to "develop and submit to the community for approval" regulations to give effect to the
Code
. The fact that the
Regulations
were not even in existence at the time of the plebiscites eliminates any possibility they received community approval at that juncture. In fact, the applicant did not lead any evidence to support a finding that these
Regulations
were submitted to the community for approval in any manner.
[70]
As I concluded above that the
Code
is valid and reflects the Band's custom, it can therefore be said that the Band's custom permits the Band Council to develop regulations to give effect to the
Code
, subject to one condition: the Band Council must submit the said regulations to the community for approval. I am of the view that unless this condition has been satisfied, any regulations purportedly developed pursuant to s. 19 are invalid. Since no evidence has been adduced to establish that the
Regulations
were approved by the community, I am of the view they must be declared invalid. The Band Council acted ultra vires the jurisdiction conferred upon it by s. 19 of the
Code
.
What Is The Effect Of A Declaration
That The Regulations Are Invalid
On The Order Of The
Elections Appeal Board?
[71]
The applicant appealed the results of the March 14, 1994, election pursuant to s. 15.1 of the
Code
, by submitting a written appeal within seven days of the election to the Election Appeals Board. [see footnote 31] Pursuant to that appeal, the Election Appeal Board issued an order, dated March 26, 1994, declaring that a new general election be held. The power to order a new election is conferred upon the Elections Appeal Board by s. 13(3) of the
Regulations
. [see footnote 32] The
Code
itself does not empower the Board to grant such an order. Accordingly, a declaration of invalidity of the
Regulations
renders the order for a new general election ultra vires the jurisdiction of the Elections Appeal Board.
[72]
In summary, I am of the view that the
Regulations
were enacted ultra vires the jurisdiction of the Band Council, as there is no evidence they were submitted to the community for approval, as is required by the enabling provision in the
Code
. I have the further view that the order of the Elections Appeal Board declaring a new general election be held is invalid. I so conclude because, in the absence of an empowering regulation, the Election Appeals Board is without jurisdiction to grant such an order.
4. Should The Respondent Ron Hall
Be Removed From The Office Of
The Chief Of The Sioux Valley
Indian Band By The Issuance Of A Writ Of Quo Warranto?
[73]
The respondent Hall may only be removed from office of the Band Chief by the issuance of a writ of quo warranto if the court is satisfied that the respondent Hall has no legal basis for holding this position. Since I have concluded supra that the order of the Elections Appeal Board is invalid, the applicant is unable to rely on the order of the Elections Appeal Board in support of his submission that the respondent Hall is thereby disentitled to hold the office of Band Chief.
[74]
It must therefore be determined whether the respondent Hall is disentitled from holding office by virtue of the residency requirement as set out in the
Code
. Section 7 of the
Code
reads as follows:
"7. Dakota Oyate members who are 18 years of age or over, and have resided on the Reserve for the past 12 months prior to the election date may run for Chief and Councillor."
Therefore, if the respondent Hall did not reside on the Reserve for the 12 months prior to the election date, that is during the period of March 14, 1993, to March 14, 1994, then he was not eligible to run for Chief. Unfortunately, the
Code
itself does not provide an interpretation of the words "resided on the Reserve": that interpretation was included in the
Regulations
, which I have concluded are invalid. Accordingly, s. 7 of the
Code
must be interpreted without the assistance of a definition.
[75]
It is not disputed that on August 31, 1992, House No. 3700, which is located on the Reserve, was transferred from Louise Hall, the respondent Hall's sister, to the respondent Hall. [see footnote 33] However, it is also not disputed that prior to August 31, 1992, and at least until May 31, 1993, the respondent Hall also held title to a residential property located at 12 Beech Boulevard, in Brandon, Manitoba, which was not on the Reserve. [see footnote 34] The respondent Hall stated, under oath, during cross-examination upon his affidavit that sometime in October of 1992 he moved some furniture into House 3700, in November of 1992 he began eating lunch in House 3700 occasionally, and in April or May of 1993 he began sleeping in House 3700 occasionally on weekends, as he had began renovations. Prior to this he had continued to sleep at his residence in Brandon. The respondent Hall further stated that he had three school-aged children, who attended school in Brandon during the school term of September, 1992 to June, 1993. None of the children ever slept at House 3700 until April or May of 1993. It was not until the later part of May, 1993, that he began sleeping exclusively at House 3700. [see footnote 35]
[76]
In support of his submissions as to residency on the Reserve, the respondent Hall attached as Exhibit J to his Affidavit business records of the Band which indicate that financial assistance was provided to himself and his wife during the period of January, 1993, to March of 1994. In his view, this was evidence that he was resident on the Reserve, as according to established Band policy, no Band member is eligible for such assistance unless such member is resident on the Reserve. In my view, marginal weight ought to be accorded this evidence. The definition of "residence" for the purpose of receiving financial assistance is not determinative of the issue at hand.
[77]
The question remains: as of March 14, 1993, did the respondent Hall reside on the Reserve? According to his own testimony supra, it is apparent that as of March, 1993, the material date, the respondent Hall had not even slept in House 3700. In March of 1993 the respondent Hall was the owner of a house located on the Reserve. He had moved some of his possessions into the house and occasionally ate a meal there. However, at the material time he also held joint title to a home located off the Reserve, in Brandon, where the remainder of his possessions were located and where he and his family slept every night.
[78]
Without having to decide whether or not a person may have more than one residence, I am of the view that the respondent Hall did not reside on the Reserve as of March 14, 1993. The fact that he did commence residing on the Reserve at any time subsequent to March 14, 1993, is of no avail to him, as the Code clearly requires a candidate for the office of Chief or Councillor to have resided on the Reserve for a minimum of 12 months prior to the election date. Accordingly, the respondent Hall was not eligible to run as a candidate for Chief in the March 14, 1994, election and accordingly, is not entitled to hold office as Chief.
[79]
The issue now is to determine if an order in the nature of quo warranto should issue in the circumstances of this case. Justice Teitelbaum in
Jock
, supra, set out the following rules in regards to the issuance of a writ of quo warranto:
"According to de Smith's
Judicial Review of Administrative Action
(4th Ed. by J.M. Evans, 1980), the old substantive law rules for quo warranto, with only slight modifications, still apply, as listed below (at pp. 463-464):
1. The office must be one of a public nature.
2. The holder must have already exercised the office; a mere claim to exercise it is not enough.
3. The office must have been created by the Crown, by a Royal Charter, or by an Act of Parliament.
4. The office must not be that of a deputy or servant who can be dismissed at will.
5. A plaintiff will be barred from a remedy if the plaintif [sic] has been guilty of acquiescence in the usurpation of office or undue delay.
6. The plaintiff must have a genuine interest in the proceedings. Nowadays probably any member of the public will have sufficient interest, provided that he has no private interest to serve.
"The following matters are within the discretion of the court (Dussault and Borgeat,
Administrative Law: A Treatise
, 1990, p. 388):
7. Standing of the applicant.
8. The reasonableness of the length of time elapsed since the election.
9. The appropriateness of requiring that all internal relief avenues be first exhausted.
"The following are some additional factors to be considered in a discussion of the remedy of quo warranto:
10. Whether the onus is on the applicant or the respondent to prove his case.
11. Whether the remedy of quo warranto may be granted independent of any other remedy." (
Jock
, supra, at pp. 370-371.)
The above factors must now be applied to the facts of the case at bar.
1. Office Of A Public Nature
[80]
The applicant has only sought an order in the nature of a writ of quo warranto with respect to the Band Chief, Ron Hall. Justice Teitelbaum in Jock, supra, held that the offices of councillor and chief are "of a public nature" (at p. 371).
2. Exercised The Office
[81]
It is undisputed that the respondent Ron Hall has exercised the office of Band Chief since March of 1994.
3. Office Created By An
Act Of Parliament
[82]
Justice Teitelbaum in
Jock
, supra, held that the offices of councillors and chief could be said to have been created by the
Indian Act
. The impugned Council in that case had also been elected according to the custom of the band.
4. Deputy Or Servant That
May Be Dismissed At Will
[83]
The office of Band Chief is an elected position, and he may not be dismissed at will. As is illustrated by this litigation, removal of the Band Chief from office requires recourse to the
Code
.
5. Plaintiff Guilty Of Aquiescence
[84]
"A plaintiff will be barred from a remedy if the plaintiff has been guilty of acquiescence in the usurpation of office or undue delay." The respondents' submit the applicant is guilty of acquiescence or undue delay, as he was present at the nomination meeting when the respondent Hall was nominated for the office of Chief, and he then believed the respondent Hall did not meet the residency requirement, however he did not protest his nomination at that time.
[85]
The respondent has submitted evidence to support the contention that the applicant believed at the time of the nominations, that the respondent Hall did not meet the residency requirement. [see footnote 36] The applicant admitted in cross-examination on affidavit by the respondents' counsel, that at the nomination meeting he believed that the respondent Hall did not qualify to be a candidate because of the residency requirement. When questioned by the respondents' counsel as to why he did not object to the respondent Hall running at that time, he responded it was his opinion that it was the job of the Chief Electoral Officer to tell Mr. Hall that he could not run. respondents' counsel inquired as to whether the applicant approached the Chief Electoral Officer after the nomination meeting to tell her that it was his view Mr. Hall was ineligible. The applicant responded he did not because there was a movement on the reserve by the supporters of Mr. Hall, going around house to house with a petition to evict the applicant and his family from the community. [see footnote 37] The respondents therefore submitted that the applicant acquiesced in the candidacy of the respondent.
[86]
The applicant's response to this submission is contained in the applicant's counsel's argument at pp. 84 and 85 of the transcripts as follows:
"Mr. Nelko: ... [T]he fact is that acquiescence may come to play with respect to quo warranto. If an individual has, in fact, participated in the process, an argument is advanced that, in fact, by acquiescing to the process, that may, in fact, disentitle you from the relief.
"Of course, we have a backward situation here where we're suggesting that the respondents in fact, have acquiesced in the process and that should estop them from in fact arguing that the process is invalid." [see footnote 38]
I agree with the applicant that the respondents have acquiesced in the process, assuming the applicant is referring to the process by which the respondents were elected to the Band Council. However, this conduct on the part of the respondents is completely irrelevant to the question of whether or not the applicant himself acquiesced in the candidacy of the respondent Hall.
[87]
The facts are these: the respondent Hall was nominated as a candidate for the office of Band Chief at a nomination meeting held on February 28, 1994. The applicant was present at that meeting and was also nominated for the candidacy of Band Chief. No person, including the applicant, objected to the respondent Hall's nomination at that time or at any time prior to the March 14, 1994, election. [see footnote 39] It is not disputed that at the time of the respondent Hall's nomination the applicant was fully aware that the respondent Hall did not meet the residency requirement as was set out in the
Code
and
Regulations
. It is also not disputed that the applicant did not challenge the respondent Hall's eligibility for the office of Chief until the election was concluded.
[88]
Following the election, it is fair to say that the applicant acted promptly in submitting his appeal to the Election Appeal Board, at which time he did challenge the respondent's eligibility to hold office as Chief. The applicant submitted his written appeal dated March 18, 1994, only four days following the election. The question arises: does the applicant's prompt response to the respondent Hall's election as Band Chief rectify the applicant's acquiescence in the respondent Hall's candidacy for office? I am of the view that it does not.
[89]
In full awareness that the respondent Hall, the applicant's sole competition for the office of Chief, did not meet the residency requirement of the
Code
and
Regulations
, the applicant accepted his own nomination for the office of Chief and participated in the election which followed. The applicant allowed his office as Band Chief, which he had held for the previous eight years, to be contested by a candidate he believed was not even eligible to run. However, the applicant did not draw this to the attention of the electoral officer. Rather, he let the tainted process continue. It was only once the election results were known that the applicant publicly disputed the respondent Hall's eligibility to hold office. I am of the view that in light of these circumstances, it can fairly be said the applicant acquiesced in the candidacy of the respondent Hall.
[90]
With respect to undue delay, this is not an issue here. The applicant appealed the election results within days of the election occurring. The applicant's difficulty is not one of delay, but rather is one of acquiescence, as discussed supra.
[91]
According to the rules enunciated by Justice Teitelbaum in
Jock
, supra, the following three factors are within the discretion of the court.
7. Standing Of The Applicant
[92]
As the applicant is a member of the Band, lives on the Reserve, and was a candidate in the election, I find that he has sufficient interest in the matter to have standing.
8. Length Of Time Since Election
[93]
The election was in March of 1994, and within a few days of the election the applicant appealed the results to the Election Appeal Board. However, the applicant did not actually file the originating notice of motion with respect to this application until October of 1994. The applicant deposed in his affidavit that following the election, the Band's auditors conducted an audit with respect to certain Band financial matters. He deposed he did not attempt to institute court proceedings with respect to his challenge to the election results until after the audit was completed, as he felt it would be in the best interests of the Band for any questions regarding the results of this audit to be resolved prior to any court challenge.
[94]
The applicant's counsel further addressed the issue of delay at the hearing. Apparently the applicant encountered a number of difficulties in retaining counsel in relation to this application for judicial review. Finally in August of 1994 he retained his present counsel. However, the Originating Notice was not filed until October of 1994.
[95]
The Elections Appeal Board's order was not rendered until March 26, 1994. Taking into consideration that a reasonable amount of time had to be allowed to permit the Band Council to comply with the order, I am of the view that filing the application for judicial review six months following the election, in these circumstances, was not an unreasonable length of time since the election.
9. All Internal Relief Avenues Exhausted
[96]
Justice Teitelbaum in
Jock
, supra, stated that "where the law provides another remedy, quo warranto may not be used to contest any election". (
Jock
, at p. 374) The applicant in the case at bar did use the appeal mechanism provided for by the
Code
, however the respondents have refused to abide by the order of the Election Appeal Board.
[97]
The respondents' submit, that if the
Code
and
Regulations
were in effect, there were three means of removing Mr. Hall from office:
(1) an order of the Election Appeal Board under s. 15.2 of the
Code
and s. 13(3) of the
Regulations
;
(2) a vote under s. 15 of the
Code
; and
(3) an Order-in-Council under s. 79 of the
Indian Act
.
[98]
As to the first means of removing respondent Hall, that is the avenue the applicant chose to pursue: an appeal to the Elections Appeal Board. The Elections Appeal Board issued an order declaring that a new general election be called. It is the respondents refusal to comply with this order that precipitated this litigation.
[99]
The second remedy available to the applicant is contained in s. 15 of the
Code
, which reads as follows:
"15. The Chief, and any Councillor, may be removed from office by 65% of the total eligible voters of the Sioux Valley Dakota Oyate by a vote in a meeting held within the territorial boundaries of the Sioux Valley Dakota Nation and upon such recall a new election for Chief and/or Councillor(s) shall then be held."
I agree with the respondents that the applicant could have achieved his goal of removing the respondent Hall from the office of Band Chief by taking action under s. 15 of the
Code
. Whether or not the applicant would have succeeded is not relevant. The fact remains that this was an avenue by which a Chief could be removed from office.
[100]
Justice Teitelbaum stated in
Jock
, supra, that "[w]here the law provides another remedy, quo warranto may not be used to contest an election". However, he further stated that "[a]ccording to Dussault and Borgeat (supra), the court has discretion to determine 'the appropriateness of requiring that all internal relief avenues be first exhausted' (p. 388)". In my view, in the circumstances of the case at bar, it is not appropriate to have required the applicant to have exhausted this internal relief avenue. Assuming the applicant had been successful in attaining a vote of 65% in favour of removing the respondent Hall from office, it is quite likely the applicant would still be in the position he is today, since the efficacy of this remedy depends upon the Band Council calling a new election. The applicant had already succeeded in obtaining an order of the Elections Appeal Board that a new general election be held. This order was not being complied with. I am of the view the applicant cannot be faulted for failing to exhaust this remedial avenue.
[101]
The third internal relief avenue said by the respondents to have been available to the applicant is to be found in s. 79 of the
Indian Act
, which reads as follows:
"79. The Governor-in-Council may set aside the election of a chief or councillor of a band on the report of the Minister that he is satisfied that
(a) there was corrupt practice in connection with the election;
(b) there was a contravention of this Act that might have affected the result of the election; or
(c) a person nominated to be a candidate in the election was ineligible to be a candidate."
Justice Teitelbaum in
Jock
, supra, was of the view in that case that s. 79 offered an internal avenue of relief, even though the election in dispute was held according to band custom, rather than under the
Indian Act
. With all due respect, I am of the view that s. 79 is not applicable to band council elections that are not governed by the
Indian Act
, which is the case here. In the absence of a ministerial order pursuant to s. 74 of the
Act
, the election provisions of the
Act
are inapplicable to a band council election. Accordingly, in my view this was not an avenue of internal relief available to the applicant.
[102]
The following are additional factors to be considered with respect to an order in the nature of quo warranto:
10. Onus
[103]
Neither party has made any submission as to who had the onus to prove his case. In my view, it is the applicant who must establish why the respondent Hall is not legally in office, as prima facie he was duly elected under Band custom.
11. Quo Warranto - May It Be
Independent Of Any Other Remedy
[104]
Justice Teitelbaum in
Jock
, supra, held that quo warranto could be granted independent of any other remedy.
[105]
In summary, there is one serious impediment to a determination that an order in the nature of quo warranto is appropriate in these circumstances: the applicant acquiesced in the respondent Hall's candidacy for the office of Band Chief. In my view, in light of the circumstances of this case, this fact is sufficient to render an order in the nature of quo warranto inappropriate.
5. Should The Respondent Band Council
Be Required To Hold A New General
Election For The Offices Of Band Chief
And Councillors By The Issuance
Of A Writ Of Mandamus?
[106]
As I concluded above that the order of the Elections Appeal Board that a new general election be called is ultra vires the Board's jurisdiction, there is no basis for this court to make an order in the nature of mandamus requiring the Band Council to hold a new general election.
6. Should The Respondent Ron Hall
Be Prevented From Running As A
Candidate In A New Election For
The Office Of Band Chief By
An Injunction?
[107]
In view of the determination of the above issues, resolution of this issue is no longer necessary.
V. Conclusion
[108]
For the foregoing reasons, I declare that as of March 14, 1994, the
Sioux Valley Dakota Oyate Custom Election Code
dated July 1993 was in force, however the
Custom Election Regulations
dated February 8, 1994 were not in force. All other relief sought by the applicant is declined.
[109]
The aggregate result of the above determinations is as follows. The Band Council finds its legal basis for holding office in the
Code
. The next Band Council election, which by my calculation is due to occur within the next couple of months, may proceed in accordance with the
Code
. If the Band membership is dissatisfied with the present state of the
Code
, s. 22 of the
Code
embodies an amending provision. Although the
Regulations
have been declared invalid, there is nothing preventing the present Band Council from developing valid regulations and submitting them to the community for approval.
[110]
As neither party has made submissions as to special reasons for an order of costs, no costs shall be payable in respect of this application.
Order accordingly.
