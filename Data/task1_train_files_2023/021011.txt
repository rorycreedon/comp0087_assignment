[Translation]: This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Division, which held that the applicant is not a Convention refugee.
[2]
Essentially, the applicant, a citizen of Haiti, is claiming refugee status based on his membership in a particular social group: the poor. It is important to note that this group has been recognized as a social group by the Federal Court of Appeal. However, the court clearly stated that it is at all times the responsibility of the members of the Refugee Division to weigh the evidence in order to determine whether a particular applicant satisfies the requirements of the
Act
.
[3]
In this case, the members of the Refugee Division found that the applicant did not state reasons which would establish his claim, either in his testimony or in his answer to question 33 of his personal information form.
[4]
The applicant admitted that he did not establish that he was personally subject to persecution. He added, however, that since the documentary evidence clearly shows that the poor are mistreated in Haiti, the Board members erred in holding that no evidence of persecution was presented.
[5]
In my opinion, the applicant's claim is entirely unfounded. It is settled law that an applicant must demonstrate an objective and subjective fear of persecution. In this case, it was not sufficient simply to file documentary evidence. It was necessary at the very least to establish that the applicant himself had a real fear of persecution. In the absence of such evidence, the Bord members were entitled to conclude as they did.
Application dismissed.
