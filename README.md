Statistical NLP Research Project

## Project Description
(Abstract)

## Project Structure
- `experiments/`: Contains the scripts to make predictions. Main files include:
  - `train.py`: Fine-tunes the inference model.
  - `grid_search_opt.py`: Optimises the inference model via grid search.
  - `test.py`: Tests the inference model.
- `summaries/`: Contains the scripts to generate summaries
- `plots/`: Contains plots used in the report.
- `download_hf_data.py`: Downloads the ECHR dataset.
- `NLP_Demo_Notebook.ipynb`: Provides examples on how to use the models and perform inference.
- `plots.ipynb`: Generates plots for results.
- `requirements.txt`: Includes required dependencies.
- `results.xlsx`: Contains inference results across all models.

## Installation
Install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
