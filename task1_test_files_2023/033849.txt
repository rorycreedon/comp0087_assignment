Wetston, J.
: The plaintiffs seek to set aside two Orders issued by Mr. Giles, the Associate Senior Prothonotary, on April 21, 1995. Essentially, there are two main issues in this appeal. The first involves the jurisdiction of the Federal Court. The second involves the relationship between a pension awarded under the
Pension Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-6, and any further proceedings that may be taken against the Crown in respect of the plaintiff's injury or disability under the
Pension Act
and
the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-50.
Background
[2]
On December 9, 1992, the plaintiffs commenced this action. At all material times, Brian Arsenault and the individual defendants Dr. Portner, Dr. Bekeris, and Dr. Milczarek were members of the Canadian Armed Forces (the "CAF"). The plaintiff Vicki Arsenault is the wife of Brian Arsenault. The plaintiffs Amber, Sarah, and Tyler Arsenault are their children.
[3]
The plaintiff Brian Arsenault served as a member of the CAF for more than 10 years, until he was released from service in September of 1992. Mr. Arsenault began experiencing lower back pain in March of 1987, while serving with the CAF in Lahr, West Germany. He was eventually diagnosed with spondylolysis, a lower-back condition. On May 10, 1988, Dr. Portner gave the plaintiff the option of undergoing spinal fusion to correct his lower-back condition, or terminating his employment with the Department of National Defence. The plaintiff opted for surgery, and the operation was subsequently carried out by Dr. Portner on July 27, 1988. Post-surgery treatment and follow-up were carried out by the defendants Drs. Portner, Bekeris, and Milczarek.
[4]
In September of 1992, Mr. Arsenault discovered that complete fusion had not been achieved. Within the month, Mr. Arsenault was discharged from the CAF because he was physically unable to carry out the duties assigned to him. Mr. Arsenault was awarded a four-fifths pension entitlement, effective September 23, 1992, on the basis that his condition, or its aggravation, was directly connected to his military service.
[5]
While a number of torts are pleaded, Mr. Arsenault basically seeks damages in negligence for medical malpractice committed by the defendant physicians. Furthermore, Mr. Arsenault argues that he was subject to ill-treatment by the individual defendants, contrary to s. 95 of the
National Defence Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. N-5. Mr. Arsenault also bases his claims against the three physicians on ss. 7 and 12 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
. Finally, Mr. Arsenault claims damages against the Crown on the basis of vicarious liability for the negligent acts and omissions of its servants, all of whom were members of the CAF. The plaintiffs Vicki, Amber, Sarah, and Tyler Arsenault claim damages pursuant to s. 61 of the Ontario
Family Law Act
, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3.
[6]
The defendants, by way of two separate motions, sought to strike the Statement of Claim on the basis of jurisdiction and/or on the basis that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. The Associate Senior Prothonotary granted the orders sought by the defendants. He decided that the Federal Court of Canada does not have jurisdiction to try the claim for damages for negligence against the three individual defendants, as there exists no applicable federal law of negligence. He further held that this court does not have the jurisdiction to try any claims based on an entitlement created by the Ontario
Family Law Act,
because that enactment is not a law of the Parliament of Canada. Moreover, the Associate Senior Prothonotary determined that a pension had been granted with respect to the disability resulting from the alleged negligent conduct of the three individual defendants. Accordingly, he also struck the claim against the Crown, as it disclosed no cause of action within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court.
[7]
By Notice of Motion, dated April 27, 1995, the plaintiffs sought to set aside the two Orders granted by the Associate Senior Prothonotary. The plaintiffs assert, firstly, that Giles, A.S.P., erred in concluding that the court does not have jurisdiction to try any claim based on an entitlement created by the Ontario
Family Law Act
. Secondly, they contend that Giles, A.S.P., erred in concluding that there is no applicable Canadian law of negligence. Finally, the plaintiffs submit that Giles, A.S.P., erred in concluding that the pleadings show that a pension has been granted with respect to the disability resulting from the alleged negligent conduct of the three individual defendants.
Analysis
[8]
I am guided in this appeal of the two Orders of the Associate Senior Prothonotary by the decision in
Canada
v
.
Aqua-Gem Investments Ltd.
, [1993] 2 F.C. 425; 149 N.R. 273 (F.C.A.), as recently applied in
Scientific Games Inc.
v
.
Pollard Banknote Ltd.
, [1993] F.C.J. No. 1311 (T.D.). If the Associate Senior Prothonotary did, in fact, err, this is the type of case in which his Orders should be set aside.
a)
Jurisdiction To Try Mr. Arsenault's
Claim Against The Three
Individual Defendants
[9]
In striking the action against the three physicians, Giles, A.S.P., concluded that there is no applicable Canadian law of negligence. It is well known that the case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , established three criteria for Federal Court jurisdiction, all of which must be satisfied. In this regard, I have also considered
Rasmussen and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.).
(1) Federal Statutory Grant Of Jurisdiction
[10]
Section 17(5)(b) of the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, provides the Federal Court with jurisdiction where claims are made against Crown servants. Assuming, without deciding, that the three physicians are Crown servants, is the first requirement of
ITO
satisfied?
[11]
It is contended by the defendants that the pleadings clearly indicate that the physicians are sued in their personal, rather than representative capacity. Section 17(5)(b) of the
Federal Court Act
is intended to confer jurisdiction over Crown servants in their representative capacity, i.e., in the performance of their duties as servants of the Crown. Therefore, it is argued that the first requirement of the
ITO
test is not satisfied. While the individual defendants also submitted additional arguments under this first branch, I am of the opinion that s. 17(5)(b) of the
Federal Court Act
appears to satisfy the first requirement of the
ITO
test:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.). In any event, this question need not be answered here, given my determination under the second branch of the
ITO
test.
(2) Existing Body Of Federal Law Essential To The Case
[12]
Does the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
provide a body of existing federal law which is essential to this case, and which nourishes the statutory grant of jurisdiction conferred in s. 17(5)(b) of the
Federal Court Act
? In my view, it does not. The
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
provides a body of existing federal law under which actions against the federal Crown may be taken. The legislation does not provide a right of action against Crown servants. Servants of the Crown are personally liable, however, under the general law of the province in which the tort was committed:
Rasmussen
, supra.
[13]
Section 3(a) of the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
grants to the Federal Court of Canada the jurisdiction to entertain a claim against the Crown even though it may not entertain an action against the Crown servants in respect of whom the Crown's vicarious liability arises. A cause of action which is asserted against a servant of the Crown, and which is founded upon the tort of negligence, does not arise from federal law. Therefore, the Federal Court cannot assume jurisdiction over such a claim:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.). In the present case, the basis for relief against the individual defendants is the statutory and common law of Ontario -- the province in which the torts allegedly occurred. Thus, this court does not have the jurisdiction to entertain such claims.
[14]
Alternatively, the plaintiffs have attempted to tie their various claims to other federal legislation, so as to meet the second requirement of the
ITO
test. In particular, the plaintiffs rely upon s. 95 of the
National Defence Act
as a basis for arguing that an existing body of federal law governs their claims. That section states:
"95. Every person who strikes or otherwise ill treats any person who by reason of rank or appointment is subordinate to him is guilty of an offence and on conviction is liable to imprisonment for less than two years or to less punishment."
This provision creates an offence, not a right of action against a Crown servant. It cannot be viewed as an existing federal law which nourishes the Federal Court's statutory grant of jurisdiction. Moreover, in Canada, there is no tort arising out of a statutory breach in and of itself:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[15]
The plaintiffs also rely upon the cases of
Bradasch
v
.
Warren et al.
, [1990] 3 F.C. 32; 111 N.R. 149 (F.C.A.) and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). In my opinion,
Bradasch
, supra, cannot apply in this case. In that decision, the plaintiff grounded his claim in tort for an act committed in the Yukon. Only the Parliament of Canada may make laws for the government of the Yukon territory, including tort law:
Yukon Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. R-10. It is clear that
Bradasch
, supra, is therefore distinguishable from the case at bar.
[16]
In the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case, supra, the Federal Court of Appeal found that the two statutes relevant to the disposition of the case -- the
Penitentiary Act
, R.S.C. 1970, c. P-6, and the
Parole Act
, R.S.C. 1970, c. P-2 --created a detailed statutory framework of federal law under which the appellant acquired certain rights. The torts complained of were allegedly committed in violation of these statutorily-created rights. Consequently, the torts depended for their existence upon federal law. In the present case, however, it cannot be said that s. 95 of the
National Defence Act
provides a statutorily-created federal right upon which the claims in this case can be founded.
[17]
Given my conclusions regarding the second requirement of the
ITO
test, it is unnecessary to deal with the third criterion: a law of Canada on which the case is based.
b)
Jurisdiction To Try Mr. Arsenault's
Claim Against Her Majesty The Queen
[18]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  exist when a claim may be undeniably launched against the Crown, but not necessarily against the individual defendants. It is clear that there may be a statutory grant of jurisdiction to sue the Crown in this case:
Federal Court Act
, s. 17(5)(b). However, the Crown argues that, because a pension has been paid, the plaintiffs are barred from suing the Crown.
[19]
Section 3(a) and s. 10 of the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
impose vicarious liability upon the Crown for the personal torts of its servants. Proceedings against the Crown arising out of s. 3(a) of the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
are limited by s. 111 of the
Pension Act,
and by s. 9 of the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
. The Crown, therefore, argues that the actions in this case are barred, as the disability arose in circumstances in which a pension has been paid.
[20]
Mr. Arsenault did receive a four-fifths pension entitlement when he was released from the CAF. He claims, however, that it was not awarded in respect of the alleged inadequate medical care received from the defendant physicians. In support of this assertion, the plaintiffs note that the Veterans Appeal Board (the "Appeal Board") upheld the four-fifths pension entitlement which had been awarded to Mr. Arsenault by the Entitlement Board (the "Board"), after the Appeal Board considered new medical evidence that suggested that inadequate medical care may have been provided. It is contended that since the pension was not increased on the basis of this new evidence, the four-fifths pension was not intended to compensate Mr. Arsenault for damages arising from the alleged negligence of the defendants. Accordingly, the plaintiffs assert that Mr. Arsenault has not received a pension "in respect of" his injury, as required in s. 111 of the
Pension Act
and s. 9 of the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
. Therefore, they argue, the claim for damages for professional negligence is not barred.
[21]
According to the decision of the Entitlement Board, dated July 29, 1993, Mr. Arsenault originally claimed that his condition was pensionable, and that it met the requirement in s. 21(2) of the
Pension Act
. The Board agreed that, based on medical evidence, a major aggravation had taken place; therefore, a four-fifths pension entitlement was awarded. In the Board's view, one-fifth of Mr. Arsenault's problem resulted from his pre-existing back condition, while the remainder resulted from work-related aggravation of his pre-existing condition, i.e., four-fifths of his disability was directly connected to his military service. This finding was confirmed by the Appeal Board, which concluded that Mr. Arsenault was well-compensated by way of his four-fifths entitlement award "for that part of the claimed condition which is considered service-connected." This finding of the Appeal Board has not been set aside.
[22]
Even if there was negligence, Mr. Arsenault has received the maximum amount of pension available to him as a result of his military service, given his pre-existing condition. Furthermore, while the plaintiffs argue that the pension which Mr. Arsenault received was not granted to him "in respect of" his military service, at para. 20(b) of the Statement of Claim it is asserted that a connection existed between his military service and the injuries for which he now claims damages. Therefore, it appears that Mr. Arsenault's pension was awarded "in respect of" his military service.
[23]
The plaintiffs also rely upon
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), reving. (1990), 34 F.T.R. 85 (T.D.). In my view, neither of these cases supports the plaintiffs' claims.
[24]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, the plaintiff was not receiving a disability pension at the time he commenced his action. Indeed, he argued that his injury was
not
"directly connected" to his military service, and that a pension should therefore not be awarded pursuant to s. 12(2) (now s. 21(2)) of the
Pension Act
. The Supreme Court essentially upheld this position. Therefore, Mr. Merineau's actions against the Crown proceeded.
[25]
In a recent decision, Nadon, J., had occasion to consider <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, in the context of deciding whether or not the Federal Court has jurisdiction to determine if a pension is payable:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.). According to Nadon, J., if the Pension Commission and the Pension Review Board have determined that a pension is payable, then the action is barred by s. 111 of the
Pension Act
and s. 9 of the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
. Similarly, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), Stone, J.A., held that s. 9 of the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
barred the plaintiffs' claims arising out of alleged negligent acts of the defendant Crown servants, since compensation had already been paid "in respect of" the damage or loss.
[26]
In the present case, the Appeal Board concluded that the plaintiff's disability
was
"directly connected" to his military service. The legislation therefore precludes Mr. Arsenault from obtaining further compensation by way of damages in respect of the same injury. For the above reasons, then, the plaintiffs' claim against the Crown is barred by s. 111 of the
Pension Act
and s. 9 of the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
.
c)
Jurisdiction To Try The Claims Of
Vicki, Amber, Sarah, And Tyler Arsenault
[27]
Mr. Arsenault's wife and children have made claims against the defendants based on s. 61 of the Ontario
Family Law Act
. These are clearly derivative claims. As such, they cannot be maintained, since the claim of Mr. Arsenault, from which these claims are derived, shall be struck. Moreover, the Ontario
Family Law Act
cannot be considered a federal law as required by the second criterion in
ITO
.
[28]
Accordingly, the motion to set aside the Orders of Giles, A.S.P., shall be dismissed.
Motion dismissed.
