Pinard, J.
: These are the reasons in support of a judgment disposing of the action of the plaintiff solely as against the defendant Les Editions JCL Inc. (hereinafter referred to as  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), the co-defendant Louise Denis-Labrie having made an assignment in bankruptcy on December 17, 1990 and having since been discharged.
[2]
The plaintiff and the defendant JCL are both corporations each of which operates a publishing business. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant has infringed the copyright which had been assigned to it and accordingly seeks various remedies as provided by the
Copyright Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-42, including a permanent injunction, damages, and so on. The defendant JCL, for its part, simply denies having infringed the plaintiff's copyright, [Translation] "in view of the fact that it was ignorant of the infringement committed by the defendant Labrie" (amended statement of defence, para. 8). At trial, counsel for the defendant JCL expressly waived the defence under s. 39 of the
Act
; we shall therefore not have to consider whether this provision applies here.
"39. Where proceedings are taken in respect of the infringement of the copyright in any work and the defendant in his defence alleges that he was not aware of the existence of the copyright in the work, the plaintiff is not entitled to any remedy other than an injunction in respect of the infringement if the defendant proves that at the date of the infringement he was not aware and had no reasonable ground for suspecting that copyright subsisted in the work, but if at the date of the infringement the copyright in the work was duly registered under this Act, the defendant shall be deemed to have had reasonable ground for suspecting that copyright existed in the work."
Furthermore, as plaintiff by counterclaim, the defendant JCL asserts that the action is frivolous and vexatious, in fact and in law, and argued forcefully for payment of its costs in these proceedings on a solicitor and client basis.
[3]
At the hearing before me, the plaintiff and the defendant JCL made the following written admissions:
"1. The plaintiff 91439 Canada Ltée is a corporation duly incorporated under the statutes of the Parliament of Canada, having its head office and principal place of business at 171 boulevard de Mortagne, Boucherville (District of Longueuil), in the province of Quebec, Canada J4B 6G4; the plaintiff, who also does business under the names and trade names 'Editions de Mortagne' or 'Les Editions De Mortagne', operates a publishing business in Quebec.
"2. The defendant Les Editions JCL Inc. is a corporation incorporated under the statutes of the Legislature of Quebec, having its head office or principal place of business at 930 est, rue Jacques-Cartier, Chicoutimi (District of Chicoutimi), in the province of Quebec, Canada J7H 2B1: this defendant, who also does business under the names or trade names of 'Editions JCL' or 'Editions Jean-Claude Larouche', operates a publishing business in Quebec.
"3. The plaintiff is the owner of all rights, title, interests and privileges - including copyright - in a protected original literary work entitled
Un Jour La Jument Va Parler ...
, which work was first published in October 1983 in Boucherville, Canada, the author of which is Marcelyne Claudais, a Canadian citizen who assigned her rights to the plaintiff in writing.
"4. The plaintiff is the owner of all rights, title, interests and privileges - including copyright - in a protected original literary work entitled
J'espère Au Moins Qu'y Va Faire Beau!
, which work was first published in October 1985 in Boucherville, Canada, the author of which is Marcelyne Claudais, a Canadian citizen who assigned her rights to the plaintiff in writing.
"5. The plaintiff obtained confirmation of its ownership of the work
Un Jour La Jument Va Parler ...
from the Canadian Copyright Office, which issued registration certificate 367640 to it on February 24, 1988.
"6. The plaintiff obtained confirmation of its ownership of the work
J'espère Au Moins Qu'y Va Faire Beau!
from the Canadian Copyright Office, which issued registration certificate 367641 to it on February 24, 1988.
"7. All the copies of
Un Jour La Jument Va Parler ...
bear the notation, in the usual place, [Translation] 'all rights reserved: Les Editions De Mortagne (C) Ottawa 1983'.
"8. All copies of
J'espère Au Moins Qu'y Va Faire Beau!
bear the notation, in the usual place, [Translation] 'all rights reserved: Les Editions De Mortagne (C) Ottawa 1985'.
"9. The defendant Les Editions JCL Inc. is the publisher of the literary work
On M'a Volé Mon Fils
. The defendant had the literary work
On M'a Volé Mon Fils
printed by Les Editions Marquis Ltée. A first printing of 3,212 copies of
On M'a Volé Mon Fils
was produced; a second printing of 2,176 copies of
On M'a Volé Mon Fils
was produced.
"10. The retail sale price of
On M'a Volé Mon Fils
is $12.95.
"11. The retail sale price of
Un Jour La Jument Va Parler ...
is $15.95; the retail sale price of
J'espère Au Moins Qu'y Va Faire Beau!
is $15.95.
"12. Of the 5,388 copies of
On M'a Volé Mon Fils
printed, 5,000 were delivered for distribution in Canada to Québec Livres, which was also the distributor of
Un Jour La Jument Va Parler
and
J'espère Au Moins Qu'y Va Faire Beau!
"13. At least 1,378 copies of
On M'a Volé Mon Fils
were sold by Québec Livres, 94 of which were sold after December 31, 1987.
"14. The defendant Les Editions JCL Inc. has 131 copies of
On M'a Volé Mon Fils
in stock.
"15. On March 11, 1987, the defendant Les Editions JCL Inc. signed a publishing contract with the defendant Louise Denis-Labrie."
[4]
It is also in evidence that Jean-Claude Larouche, the defendant JCL's sole shareholder and sole editor, met with the co-defendant Louise Denis-Labrie, the author of the work
On M'a Volé Mon Fils
, on January 5, 1987, and that she gave him the only existing manuscript. Over the following two weeks, Jean-Claude Larouche was able to do a first reading of the manuscript, and then gave it to Geneviève Trudeau, an analyst. She produced her report on February 13, 1987, and on March 10, 1987 Jean-Claude Larouche agreed to publish the work. Until then, the manuscript which had been given to Jean-Claude Larouche had been read only by him, the analyst Geneviève Trudeau and an employee of the defendant JCL, a Ms. Martineau.
[5]
In its publishing contract of March 11, 1987, with the co-defendant Louise Denis-Labrie, the defendant JCL acquired, inter alia, the sole right to print, publish in French and reproduce
On M'a Volé Mon Fils
, obtaining an express guarantee of the originality of the work and the fact that it did not infringe any existing copyright.
[6]
Printing of the literary work
On M'a Volé Mon Fils
began at about the end of July 1987. First, however, a revision was done by the author Louise Denis-Labrie, with advice from her uncle, a professor of French. Moreover, between May 26 and 28, 1987, a proof of the volume had been given to a reader, Nicole Tremblay, for suggestions. Subsequently, on about June 15, 1987, it was read again, for the same purpose, by Roland Bourdeau, a professor of literature at the Cégep de Chicoutimi. These readings had resulted in only a few corrections.
[7]
On M'a Volé Mon Fils
having been presented to him as an autobiography for publication in the defendant JCL's collection
Témoignage
, Jean-Claude Larouche was careful, in March 1987, before agreeing to publish it, to verify and ascertain the existence of the Court judgments to which the work referred.
[8]
The book
On M'a Volé Mon Fils
was launched in Quebec City on August 18, 1987. It was put on the market at the beginning of September 1987. Between August 25 and November 4, 1987, the defendant JCL promoted it by doing a press tour in four regions of Quebec, including Montreal, Rimouski and the Saguenay, in addition to Quebec City.
[9]
At the Salon du Livre de Montréal on November 22, 1987, the author Marcelyne Claudais met Réginald Martel, an experienced journalist specializing in literature, whose attention she drew to the similarities between her two literary works
Un Jour La Jument Va Parler ...
and
J'espère Au Moins Qu'y Va Faire Beau!
, on the one hand, and the work
On M'a Volé Mon Fils
, signed Louise Denis-Labrie, on the other hand. The journalist immediately hastened to meet with Jean-Claude Larouche, who was also on the premises as a participant in the Salon, to inform him of the situation and to let him know that Ms. Labrie was guilty of plagiarism. Mr. Martel, as to whose credibility there is no doubt, testified that Jean-Claude Larouche's reaction was spontaneous and heated, even violent. He had first believed it to be a joke, and then exhibited fury and anger. On the following day, November 23, 1987, and then on November 30, 1987, the same journalist published two articles in the Montreal newspaper
La Presse
on this subject, pointing out, inter alia, that Louise Denis-Labrie had plagiarized and expressing sympathy for Jean-Claude Larouche whom he considered to have been the victim of an actionable misfortune.
[10]
Jean-Claude Larouche testified that having then been informed for the first time of the fact that Louise Denis-Labrie had taken material from the literary works of Marcelyne Claudais, he hastened to withdraw the 12 to 24 volumes of the work
On M'a Volé Mon Fils
which he had exhibited on public view at the Salon du Livre. That same Sunday, he also wrote the following telegram, which he sent the following day to Louise Denis-Labrie, with copies to the plaintiff and to the journalist Réginald Martel:
[Translation] "I was very surprised and disappointed to learn from Réginald Martel of
La Presse
on November 22 that certain passages of your book were taken from the works of the novelist Marcelline (sic) Claudais. You will now have to answer for this act of plagiarism, of which I disapprove as strongly as possible."
[11]
The following week, Jean-Claude Larouche told Louise Denis-Labrie, who had asked him whether a scheduled interview with a firm in Quebec City for promotional purposes would still be held, that [Translation] "everything was off". Then on December 17, 1987, dissatisfied with the "explanations" sent to him on December 12, 1987 by Louise Denis-Labrie, Jean-Claude Larouche wrote to his distributor, which he had already asked to stop working on and promoting the book
On M'a Volé Mon Fils
, to give it the formal order to withdraw the book from the market. Jean-Claude Larouche explained that he believed he should suspend sales of the book on the spot, for an indefinite time, in order to be able to verify the extent to which Louise Denis-Labrie had taken material from the literary works of Marcelyne Claudais and to confirm the plagiarism, which required several hundred hours' work. Then, on January 4, 1988, he wrote the following letter to the author Marcelyne Claudais:
[Translation]
"January 4, 1988
Ms. Marcelyne Claudais
Editions de Mortagne
171 boul. de Mortagne
Boucherville, Quebec
J4B 6G4
Re:
On m'a volé mon fils
Dear Ms. Claudais:
In order that we may analyze the exact situation with respect to the plagiarism by Louise Labrie, would it be possible to obtain the marked copies which (I imagine) were provided to Réginald Martel and which he showed me himself.
It would be a very long and tedious process to try to compare the two works. I would be very grateful for your cooperation in this respect. We hereby undertake to return everything to you within a reasonable time. We are very unhappy about this situation and hope that this case sets an example and discourages any other such projects.
The President
(signed by)
Jean-Claude Larouche
Editor"
[12]
Apart from the 131 copies of
On M'a Volé Mon Fils
which the defendant JCL has in stock at present, the other copies withdrawn from the market, totalling 3,513, were put into storage as they were withdrawn, and later destroyed, at about the end of December 1988, at the express request of the defendant JCL made earlier on November 22, 1988. Withdrawal of the copies of the infringing work took place over a period of some seven months, and was fully completed at the end of July 1989. On this point, the distribution contract between the defendant and Québec Livres provided for a period of six months to accomplish complete withdrawal of title.
[13]
Those of the above facts which were not admitted or established by documentary evidence are taken primarily from the testimony of the journalist Réginald Martel, whose credibility I have already noted, and of Jean-Claude Larouche. In the latter case, being aware that the witness was obviously a party to the dispute, I took care to follow his testimony and observe his behaviour. Jean-Claude Larouche appeared to me to be sincere, and despite some initial reticence in providing the name of Ms. Martineau as being the one of his two employees who had at one point read Louise Denis-Labrie's manuscript, he generally appeared to me to who to answer the questions in a complete, direct and frank manner. Moreover, I find no inconsistency in his testimony. As well, his testimony was not seriously contradicted, and so I have no hesitation in accepting it and accordingly in considering all the facts set out above as being properly proved.
[14]
We must first, in the context of this entire fact situation, determine whether the defendant JCL infringed the copyright which was the property of the plaintiff.
[15]
It was clearly established that the defendant Louise Denis-Labrie reproduced a substantial part of the protected literary works
Un Jour La Jument Va Parler ...
and
J'espère Au Moins Qu'y Va Faire Beau!
, without authorization, in the work
On M'a Volé Mon Fils
. In addition to being admitted in the pleadings, this infringement was acknowledged by counsel for the defendant JCL several times during the trial. Moreover, the document comparing the works, prepared by the author Marcelyne Claudais, left no doubt on this point.
[16]
It is also apparent that by authorizing the printing and reproduction of the infringing work
On M'a Volé Mon Fils
as it did, regardless of whether it had any specific knowledge, the publisher JCL infringed the sole right of the plaintiff, whose consent it did not have, to make or authorize such printing and reproduction. This results from the operation of the following relevant provisions of ss. 3 and 27 of the
Copyright Act
.
Section 3:
"3(1) For the purposes of this Act, 'copyright' means the sole right to produce or reproduce the work or any substantial part thereof in any material form whatever, to perform, or in the case of a lecture to deliver, the work or any substantial part thereof in public or, if the work is unpublished, to publish the work or any substantial part thereof, and includes the sole right
. . . . .
and to authorize any such acts."
Section 27:
"27(1) Copyright in a work shall be deemed to be infringed by any person who, without the consent of the owner of the copyright, does anything that, by this Act, only the owner of the copyright has the right to do."
[17]
As well, the author Fox writes on this point, in
The Canadian Law of Copyright and Industrial Designs
(2nd Ed.), at page 331 and 332:
"
Innocent Infringement
: Innocent intention affords no defence, and ignorance of the existence of copyright is no excuse for infringement. Copyright being a proprietary right, it does not avail the defendant to plead motive or intent. Neither intention to infringe, nor knowledge that he is infringing on the part of the defendant, is a necessary ingredient in the case of an action for infringement. Once the two elements of sufficient objective similarity and casual connection are established, it is no defence that the defendant was unaware (and could not have been aware) that what he was doing infringed the copyright in the plaintiff's work. To establish infringement it is not necessary to prove anything in the nature of mens rea. A printer, for instance, may be held guilty of infringement though he has no guilty intent. The question of intent will, however, have a bearing on the question of damages."
[18]
Thus, even if I conclude in this case that in authorizing the printing, reproduction and distributing for the purpose of trade of the infringing work the defendant JCL had neither the intention to infringe the copyright concerned nor the knowledge that such copyright was in fact being infringed, and accordingly there was no infringement by personal action within the meaning of s. 27(4) of the
Act
, the defendant JCL must nonetheless be considered to have infringed copyright under ss. 3(1) and 27(1) of that
Act
.
"27(4) Copyright in a work shall be deemed to be infringed by any person who
(a) sells or lets for hire, or by way of trade exposes or offers for sale or hire,
(b) distributes either for the purposes of trade or to such an extent as to affect prejudicially the owner of the copyright,
(c) by way of trade exhibits in public, or
(d) imports for sale or hire into Canada,
any work that to the knowledge of that person infringes copyright or would infringe copyright if it had been made within Canada."
Section 27(4) of the
Act
deals with specific acts, certain of which, such as distributing the infringing work and exhibiting it in public for the purpose of trade, were committed by the defendant JCL; however, JCL also performed acts which are not listed in s. 27(4), such as authorizing printing and authorizing reproduction of the infringing work, which acts, under s. 3(1) of the
Act
, the plaintiff alone had the right to perform. Only in respect of those acts performed by the defendant JCL which are listed in s. 27(4) is the question of its knowledge relevant for the purposes of determining whether or not the plaintiff's copyright was infringed. Thus by authorizing the printing and reproduction of the infringing work the defendant JCL, in law, infringed the plaintiff's copyright, even if it was unaware that the work in question infringed her copyright.
[19]
The good faith of the defendant JCL also does not mean that the remedies sought cannot to some extent be granted. On this point, we should recall what was said by Chief Justice Rinfret of the Supreme Court of Canada in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at page 302:
[Translation] "I can say immediately, on this point, that no one believes that the respondent acted in bad faith, but this is not the issue. The
Copyright Act
considers the publication of articles protected by that
Act
without the authorization of the author or of the holder of the copyright to be an infringement. And this
Act
must be applied even when the publication was done in good faith. In this case we must say: '
Dura lex sed lex
'."
[20]
The various remedies sought by the plaintiff are sought essentially under the following specific provisions of the
Act
:
"34(1) Where copyright in any work has been infringed, the owner of the copyright is, subject to this Act, entitled to all remedies by way of injunction, damages, accounts and otherwise that are or may be conferred by law for the infringement of a right.
. . . . .
"34(2) The costs of all parties in any proceedings in respect of the infringement of copyright shall be in the absolute discretion of the court.
"35(1) Where any person infringes the copyright in any work that is protected under this Act, the person is liable to pay such damages to the owner of the right infringed as he may have suffered due to the infringement, and in addition thereto such part of the profits that the infringer has made from the infringement as the court may decide to be just and proper.
"35(2) In proving profits the plaintiff shall be required to prove only receipts or revenues derived from the publication, sale or other disposition of an infringing work, or from any unauthorized performance of the work in which copyright subsists, and the defendant shall be required to prove every element of cost that he claims.
"36. The author or other owner of any copyright or any person or persons deriving any right, title or interest by assignment or grant in writing from any author or other owner may each, individually for himself, in his own name as party to a suit, action or proceeding, protect and enforce such rights as he may hold, and to the extent of his right, title and interest is entitled to the remedies provided by this Act.
"38. All infringing copies of any work in which copyright subsists, or of any substantial part thereof, and all plates used or intended to be used for the production of the infringing copies shall be deemed to be the property of the owner of the copyright, who accordingly may take proceedings for the recovery of the possession thereof or in respect of the conversion thereof."
[21]
Given the specific circumstances of this case, I therefore consider it appropriate to grant the defendant the following remedies:
A. A declaratory judgment inter partes that the literary works
Un Jour La Jument Va Parler
...
and
J'espère Au Moins Qu'y Va Faire Beau!
are protected works of which the plaintiff is the sole owner and that the defendant JCL has infringed the plaintiff's copyright in the said works.
B. A permanent injunction enjoining the defendant JCL, its administrators and officers, employees and servants, brokers, agents and mandataries, as well as any other person under its control, from reproducing, selling or letting for hire, by way of trade exposing or offering for sale or hire, distributing for the purpose of trade and by way of trade exhibiting in public the infringing work
On M'a Volé Mon Fils
by the author Louise Denis-Labrie, and finally, from otherwise using this infringing work to infringe the plaintiff's copyright in the literary works
Un Jour La Jument Va Parler ...
and
J'espère Au Moins Qu'y Va Faire Beau!
.
C. An order enjoining the defendant JCL to return to the plaintiff, under the oath of its authorized representative, all material which infringes the plaintiffs' copyright, within 30 days of service of the judgment herein, with leave to the plaintiff, at its option, to destroy the said material, the whole at the expense of the defendant JCL.
D. A judgment ordering the defendant JCL to pay to the plaintiff, taking into account the choice expressed by the plaintiff at trial, the value of the copies of the infringing work
On M'a Volé Mon Fils
which the defendant JCL had printed and which it did not sell; on this point, I find that the plaintiff is entitled to the amount claimed, $51,929.50, which represents the admitted retail price of $12.95 for each of the 4,010 infringing copies printed and not sold. It is important to recall that the infringing copies became the property of the plaintiff at the moment they were produced; the plaintiff is now therefore entitled to be in the same financial situation as it would be in if the infringing copies had not been destroyed, but had been delivered or given to it. Moreover, the damages to which it is entitled are determined on the basis of the full value of those copies at the time when the plaintiff's copyright in respect of them was usurped (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  to pay to the plaintiff, as an equitable proportion of the profits which the defendant realized by infringing the plaintiff's copyright, the minimal sum of $273.40, the equivalent of a profit fixed at $2.90 for each of the 94 copies sold after December 31, 1987 only, that is, during the seven months when the infringing copies were being gradually withdrawn from the market.
F. A judgment ordering the defendant Les Editions JCL to pay to the plaintiff, on the above sums of $51,929.50 and $273.40, totalling $52,202.90, interest at the legal rate from the date of service.
G. An award of the costs of the action to the plaintiff.
[22]
Furthermore, I find that the plaintiff did not prove that it suffered any real prejudice as a result of the infringement of its copyright by the defendant JCL and I do not believe it appropriate to award moral damages; moreover, the nature of the circumstances is far from the extraordinary circumstances required, given the good faith of the defendant JCL, in order for punitive and exemplary damages, solicitor and client costs and compound interest to be awarded. On this point, suffice it to refer to the following passage from the text by Fox (supra), at page 464:
"Where there is a great injury without the possibility of measuring compensation by any numerical rule, damages may be given in such amount as to express indignation at the defendant's wrong rather than a value set upon the plaintiff's loss.
48
In other words damages may be allowed commensurate with the gravity of the tort committed
49
, and in a proper case punitive or exemplary damages may be awarded
50
where the infringement has been accompanied by fraud or malice
51
.
48.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
51.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ."
[23]
Judgment will therefore issue upholding the plaintiff's action against the defendant JCL in part and dismissing the defendant's counterclaim, the whole in accordance with the above reasons.
Judgment for plaintiff.
