Rothstein, J.
: The issue in this judicial review of a decision of a visa officer rejecting the applicant's application for an immigrant visa is whether the visa officer erred in law in not assessing the applicant in the occupation of general economist, which was the occupation she requested for assessment.
[2]
The applicant is a citizen of the Russian Federation. She submitted an application for permanent residence in Canada under the independent category and listed her intended occupation as a general economist. (The occupation was stated in the covering letter of counsel for the applicant).
[3]
With her application she filed her Economics Degree and her "workbook" indicating that she was employed as the Leading Economic Researcher at the G.V. Plekhanov Moscow Institute of National Economy and latterly as the Economy and Finance Deputy Director of Nidan Small Enterprise. In addition, the applicant filed a letter from a Canadian export and import firm, S.D.P. Industries International, which dealt in markets of the former USSR. The letter indicated that the applicant had provided recommendations on matters relating to organizational structures of industrial enterprises, marketing policies, operating efficiency, productive methods, and future consumption. The letter also stated that S.D.P. Industries International was prepared to offer her a job in Canada as soon as she obtained her landed immigrant status.
[4]
The applicant attended an interview at the Canadian Embassy in Moscow on June 5, 1995. At that interview the visa officer asked her questions regarding her qualifications as an economist. The applicant says that after the interview she felt she had demonstrated she was an economist.
[5]
The visa officer's notes of the interview state inter alia:
"This woman is certainly not an economist in western sense know anything about monetarist theory? no-indifference curve? no-is not accountant in western sense./fits CCDO 1149-126/1135-110"
[6]
On September 8, 1995 the visa officer wrote the applicant refusing her application for permanent residence in Canada. The letter indicates that the applicant was assessed as a "manager administration" and alternatively as a "financial manager". In the assessment for "manager administration" the applicant obtained 75 units of assessment. However, the visa officer's decision states that this was an occupation which was not open to prospective independent immigrants. The relevant portion of this decision states:
"Our assessment of your qualifications was based on the occupation in which you are eligible to be considered and for which the units of assessment are the most beneficial to you. A minimum of 70 units of assessment is required in order to qualify for immigration to Canada in the independent category. A summary of this assessment is included with this letter.
"Unfortunately, you are not destined to an occupation open to prospective independent immigrants."
Attached to the decision is a document which states:
"You, as the principal applicant, were assessed based on the requirements for the following occupation which offered the most beneficial point rating:
Occupation:		Manager, Administration
.....
TOTAL:	75
You were also considered in the following occupational category, however, the total units of assessment possible in this occupation would not be more than those indicated above:
Financial Manager"
No mention is made of the occupation of general economist, which is the occupation which was the basis of the applicant's application.
[7]
The issues are (1) whether the applicant was entitled to be assessed as a general economist and (2) if so, whether such an assessment took place.

 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 172 (F.C.A.), the applicant was a medical doctor in the Philippines and a resident in pediatrics in the United States when he applied for admission to Canada as a medical technologist. The visa officer refused to assess him as a medical technologist because the officer did not believe that with his education and training, the applicant would work as a medical technologist in Canada. In finding that the visa officer erred in law by refusing to assess the applicant for admission to Canada as a medical technologist, Mahoney, J.A., states at page 176:
"In my opinion, s. 6 of the
Act
requires a visa officer to assess any immigrant who applies for landing in the manner prescribed by the
Act
and
Regulations
. Section 8(1) of the
Regulations
imposes, in mandatory terms, a duty to assess, and I find nothing in either the
Act
or
Regulations
which would permit a visa officer to refuse to assess in respect of the occupation or alternative occupations which the immigrant (or his or her spouse) states it is intended to be pursued in Canada. The visa officer erred in law and exceeded his jurisdiction by refusing to assess the appellant for admission to Canada as a medical technologist."
I think this passage makes it clear that a prospective immigrant is entitled to be assessed in the prospective immigrant's claimed occupation.
[9]
In the case at bar, the applicant was not assessed in accordance with the
Immigration Act
and
Regulations
. Sections 8(1) and (2) of the
Regulations
provide in relevant part:
"8(1) Subject to section 11.1, for the purpose of determining whether an immigrant ... will be able to become successfully established in Canada, a visa officer shall assess that immigrant ...
(a) in the case of an immigrant, other than an immigrant described in paragraph (b) or (c), on the basis of each of the factors listed in column I of Schedule I;
. . . . .
"(2) A visa officer shall award to an immigrant who is assessed on the basis of factors listed in column I of Schedule I the appropriate number of units of assessment for each factor in accordance with the criteria set out in column II thereof opposite that factor, but he shall not award for any factor more units of assessment than the maximum number set out in column III thereof opposite that factor."
An assessment is not an informal or preliminary determination by a visa officer. The terms "assess" or "assessment" mean the process of applying to the prospective immigrant the factors listed in column I of Schedule I of the
Regulations
. That this was not done with respect to the applicant's stated occupation of "general economist" is confirmed by the decision of the visa officer which states that the applicant was assessed only with respect to the occupations of "manager administration" and "financial manager".
[10]
Because the applicant was entitled to be assessed in the occupation she stated in her application, that of "general economist", and no such assessment was done in accordance with the
Immigration Act
and
Regulations
, the visa officer erred in law and exceeded his jurisdiction.
[11]
Some decisions of the Trial Division were cited which suggest that if the visa officer makes a preliminary determination that a prospective immigrant is not qualified in his or her claimed occupation, there is no need to conduct an assessment with respect to that occupation or that such determination constitutes an assessment. See for example
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 125 (T.D.), revd. (1991), 121 N.R. 260; 12 Imm. L.R.(2d) 190 (F.C.A.). Of course, each case must be decided on its own facts. However, as I have said, an assessment is not an informal determination. I am bound by
Uy
(supra), which requires that an assessment in accordance with the
Immigration Act
and
Regulations
be made with respect to a proposed immigrant's claimed occupation.
[12]
The court could envisage cases in which a proposed immigrant could state a particular occupation for which he or she was clearly not qualified. In such cases, an assessment in that occupation would seem to be unnecessary. However, the scheme of the
Act
and
Regulations
is clear. An assessment must first be made. Then, even if the prospective immigrant obtained the required number of units of assessment to be granted a visa (which would be unlikely if he or she was clearly not qualified for a claimed occupation), the visa officer has discretion under s. 11(3) of the
Regulations
to refuse to issue the visa if, in his or her opinion, there are good reasons why the number of units of assessment awarded do not reflect the chances of the particular immigrant being successfully established in Canada and those reasons have been approved by a senior immigration officer. Mahoney, J.A., dealt with this issue in
Uy
at page 176:
"Further, in my opinion, the general discretion given a visa officer by s. 9(1) of the
Regulations
, that a visa
may
be issued to an immigrant who, inter alia, is awarded at least 70 units, must be subordinated to the particular discretion given by s. 11(3) where, notwithstanding the award of at least 70 units, the visa officer is of the opinion that those units do not reflect the chances of the particular immigrant becoming successfully established in Canada. He has a discretion, but the Governor-in-Council has prescribed that he cannot exercise it alone. The reasons for the opinion must be committed to writing and submitted to and approved by a senior immigration officer."
[13]
While one can think of extreme cases, in all likelihood the more normal situation would be cases in the "grey area" where a prospective immigrant's qualifications for a particular occupation may be questionable. This is a good reason why an assessment in accordance with Schedule I of the
Regulations
is necessary. It provides an objective approach to the initial determination of the chances of a particular immigrant becoming successfully established in Canada. Where a prospective immigrant clearly does not qualify, he or she simply does not obtain the minimum number of units required for a visa. Where the required number of units are obtained, the prospective immigrant is still subject to the discretion given to the visa officer under s. 11(3) of the
Regulations
which may be exercised against the prospective immigrant if approved by a senior immigration officer.
[14]
There was no evidence before me as to the amount of time and effort involved in an assessment according to the
Act
and
Regulations
as opposed to an informal preliminary determination in cases where a visa officer is of the opinion a prospective immigrant is not qualified in a claimed occupation. I cannot conclude that compliance with the
Immigration Act
and
Regulations
is an onerous, time-consuming process that would be unreasonable to impose upon visa officers.
[15]
One final observation may be appropriate. Here, the visa officer selected the occupational classification in which to assess the applicant. The applicant obtained more than the minimum number of units required for an immigrant visa. However, she was still denied a visa because the occupation chosen by the visa officer, according to his decision, was not open to prospective independent immigrants. Whether the occupation of "general economist" was open to prospective immigrants is not known. However, it seems somewhat unfair for a visa officer to refuse to assess a prospective immigrant in her claimed occupation, to select another occupation, conclude that the immigrant obtained the minimum number of units for a visa and then decide that obtaining the minimum number of units is of no assistance as the occupation the visa officer selected is not one open to prospective immigrants. I think this outcome underscores the desirability that, for better or worse, a prospective immigrant should be assessed in accordance with the
Act
and
Regulations
under his or her claimed occupation. This, of course, does not preclude the visa officer from also assessing a prospective immigrant under alternative occupations if the facts and circumstances warrant. In fact, such an assessment may be beneficial to the prospective immigrant. However, assessing on the basis of a prospective immigrant's claimed occupation is a minimum requirement.
[16]
Counsel for the respondent requested the certification of a question for appeal to the effect: Whether an informal determination by a visa officer with respect to a prospective immigrant's stated occupation constitutes an assessment under the
Act
and
Regulations
. While I think the
Regulations
and
Uy
(supra), are clear on this point, the issue does not arise on the facts of this case because the visa officer's decision states that the applicant was assessed as a "manager administration" and "financial manager" and, by its silence, not in the applicant's stated occupation of "general economist". No question will therefore be certified.
[17]
The judicial review is allowed and the matter remitted for redetermination by a different visa officer.
Application allowed.
