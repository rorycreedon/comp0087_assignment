Giles, Associate Senior Prothonotary
: This is a motion to strike paragraph 8 of the statement of defence in which there are factual allegations purportedly supporting allegations with regard to the motive and intent of the plaintiff in bringing the action. The only case among those cited to me with regard to the appropriateness of pleading motive, which was decided in this court was  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , where Mr. Justice McNair allowed an allegation somewhat similar to paragraph 8 to stand. I note that in Cat Productions, there was a counterclaim by the defendant for damages to which the allegations of motive were relevant. In this case there is no counter claim and the allegation is irrelevant to any part of the list.

The sole relevance of paragraph 8 would appear to be to the defendant's claim for solicitor and client costs. The correctness of pleadings going solely to costs has been discussed in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , in which the opposite view was taken. I have been unable to reconcile these two decisions. It may be that where there is a patent causal connection between the pleading of motive and the prayer for solicitor and client costs, the pleading as to motive should be allowed to stand. Where, as in this case, there is no patent causal connection it may be that the allegation of motive should be struck. In the pleadings before me the causal connection is not patent. I am satisfied that the allegation of motive and the facts purporting to be a foundation for such allegation should only be permitted in a pleading when the intended purpose of the pleading is patent and relevant. Paragraph 8 of the statement of defence will be struck out in its entirety.
Order:
