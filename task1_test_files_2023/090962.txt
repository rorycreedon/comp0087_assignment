Collier, J. [orally]
: I gave reasons for judgment in this action on March 9, 1987. [See 9 F.T.R. 241]. I requested counsel for the plaintiff to draw the formal pronouncement and submit it to counsel for the defendant; if the parties were unable to agree, I said I would settle the formal judgment.
[2]
The parties have not been able to agree on some matters. The plaintiff brought a motion, in effect, to settle the judgment. There were several points discussed. I clarified one preliminary point.
[3]
In preparing for this motion to settle, I reread my reasons for judgment. I noticed two obvious errors, on my part, in the second full paragraph on page 22. I referred to "the plaintiff's contention," and later "the plaintiff had submitted". In fact, it had been the contention of the defendant, and the submission of the defendant. I had, late last week, directed two changes be made so that "defendant's" and "defendant" were to be substituted. [These corrections are reflected in the reasons reported 9 F.T.R. 241, p. 248].
[4]
There was a question raised as to whether the plaintiff was entitled to an injunction in respect of patent 864,875. (The other patent, 805,757, expired on February 11, 1986).
[5]
It is true, I did not specifically say, in my reasons, the plaintiff was entitled to an injunction. But I found validity, and infringement. I dismissed the defences of lateness and acquiescence. Having made those findings, I intended the plaintiff to have the relief requested in the prayer for relief, where applicable.
[6]
I do not think it necessary, in reasons for judgment, to set out precisely the relief to be granted to the plaintiff. That is more properly to be found in the pronouncement (formal judgment).
[7]
The same remarks apply to the discussion as to whether the plaintiff is entitled to delivery up of the offending devices.
[8]
In respect of delivery up and patent 864,875, there is a claim, or claims, involving a combination of a wheelchair having a footrest with the latch device specified in the patent. I direct there be delivery up of wheelchairs, as well as separate wheelchair parts, which offend.
[9]
In respect of patent 805,957, and delivery up, I direct that there be delivery up of wheelchairs or parts manufactured prior to February 11, 1986, that offend the claims. If the offending parts can be separated from the wheelchair, then only those parts need be delivered up.
[10]
The plaintiff sought to amend the statement of claim to request prejudgment and postjudgment interest.
[11]
I am not convinced any amendment is needed in respect of postjudgment interest. This Court can, pursuant to s. 40 of the Federal Court Act, fix a rate of interest greater, or perhaps even less, than that set out in the Interest Act. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  postjudgment interest, I direct that it shall run from March 9, 1987, the date of my reasons. The per annum rate will be the average of the Bank of Canada rate in succeeding months or years or five per cent, whichever is higher, until the date of satisfaction of the judgment.
[13]
In respect of a claim for prejudgment interest, it is my view, it should be requested in the statement of claim, or at the very latest, at some stage during the trial where the defendant can consider the matter, challenge the jurisdiction of this Court to award that kind of interest, or challenge the rates claimed.
[14]
Preferably, the claim for prejudgment interest should be set out in the statement of claim; setting out precisely what law is said to apply. The defendant then knows fully the case he has to meet. For example, in a claim for a liquidated amount, the defendant can then consider settlement, or a payment into court, and what monetary risks there are if the action proceeds to trial.
[15]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Federal Court of Appeal), the trial judge had allowed prejudgment interest, apparently applying the relevant Ontario legislation. The Federal Court of Appeal confirmed the awarding of prejudgment interest, in the somewhat unusual circumstances of that case, and of that appeal.
[16]
Here, the facts are dissimilar. The request for prejudgment interest is requested after the hearing and argument, and after reasons have issued.
[17]
It would be, as I see it, unfair, and unjust, to allow the amendment at this stage, or to entertain the request today.
[18]
Re the witness Knaub. I ruled he was qualified to give expert evidence. In my view, he is entitled to be paid (pursuant to section 4(2) of Tariff A., reasonable payment for the services performed by him in preparing to give evidence and in giving evidence.
[19]
I am not prepared to direct that the taxing officer be given power to increase the scale of counsel fees. There was nothing exceptional in this case. I refer to the C.A.E. reasons, earlier cited, and the cases referred to in those reasons.
[20]
The pronouncement will issue in accordance with these supplementary reasons.
Order accordingly.
