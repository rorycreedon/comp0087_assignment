MacKay, J.
: This application for judicial review, brought by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, seeks an order quashing or setting aside the decision of the Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the "tribunal") dated November 24, 1994. By that decision the Appeal Division allowed the appeal of the respondent from a refusal to approve the sponsored application for permanent residence of his adopted son, Randy Edrada.
[2]
The respondent is a Canadian citizen who emigrated to Canada from the Philippines in 1980. He is the paternal grandfather and adopting father of Randy Edrada, who is a resident of the Philippines. The respondent and his wife adopted Randy in 1980 prior to immigrating from the Philippines. The respondent apparently attempted to sponsor Randy in 1982 and a visa was issued to him at that time. However, Randy did not enter Canada then, and he continued to reside in the Philippines with his natural parents while the respondent resided in Canada and made occasional visits to the Philippines. The respondent claims that Randy remained in the Philippines because he was being stubborn, although evidence of both the respondent's son and Randy note that the reason for his remaining was that Randy wished to continue his education in the Philippines.
[3]
During the period from 1980 until 1989, while the respondent resided in Canada, he sent $40.00 each month for support of the youngster, and he visited Randy in the Philippines, in 1983, 1986, and in 1989. The respondent claims that he moved back to the Philippines for a period of time, and lived across the street from Randy's natural parents and Randy, as his adopted son, lived with him during this period of time.
[4]
On June 5, 1989 the respondent filed an undertaking of assistance to sponsor Randy's admission to Canada as his son. Thereafter, Randy, then aged 17, filed an application for permanent residence at the Canadian Embassy in Manila on August 18, 1989.
[5]
Apparently, a letter was issued to the respondent requesting that he provide a letter from the province of Alberta, the province in which he resided at the time, stating that the province had no objection to the arrangements made for his adopted son's immigration. By letter dated August 7, 1990 the respondent was advised by Family and Social Services for the province of Alberta that, as his son was now over 18 years of age, a letter of "no objection" would not be issued.
[6]
In addition, apparently Randy was interviewed in July 1991 at the Canadian Embassy in connection with his application at which time he stated that he wished to immigrate to Canada in order to work and so that he might sponsor his natural parents when he was financially able to do so.
[7]
By letter dated August 21, 1991 Randy was advised that his application for permanent residence had not been accepted because he was a member of an inadmissible class of persons in that he did not comply with all of the conditions or requirements of the
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, or the
Immigration Regulations
, 1978, SOR/78-172, as amended
(the "
Regulations
"). Specifically, it was found that he had not complied with s. 6(1)(c)(i) of the
Regulations
, in that he had not provided a letter of "no objection" to the proposed arrangements from the province of Alberta. In addition, the letter advised that there were insufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds to warrant special consideration of his application because the ties between Randy and his natural parents had not been severed and because he had continued to reside with his natural parents for nine years following his adoption.
[8]
By letter dated December 18, 1992 the respondent was advised that Randy Edrada is a member of an inadmissible class and that his application had been refused. Thereafter, the respondent appealed that determination to the tribunal on December 23, 1992.
[9]
A hearing was held before the tribunal on June 6, 1994 and on October 17, 1994. At the hearing of the appeal the Minister conceded that the lack of a "no objection" letter from the province of Alberta was no longer a ground for refusal because the respondent had relocated to the province of British Columbia, where no such letter was required. However, the Appeal Division permitted a motion by the Minister seeking to add as a ground for refusal that there was a lack of parent and child relationship between the respondent and Randy as required by s. 2 of the
Regulations
, as it then was.
[10]
By decision dated November 24, 1994 the tribunal allowed the respondent's appeal. The tribunal found the testimony that Randy had lived with the respondent in the Philippines across the street from his natural parents for a time after he attained the age of 16 not to be credible, on the basis that it was not consistent with the address provided on his application form. Nevertheless, in its decision the Appeal Division stated:
"Counsel for the respondent [i.e., the Minister] submitted that the definition of 'adopted' in section 2(1) of the
Regulations
should be given a broad interpretation, specifically that the phrase 'where the adoption created a relationship of parent and child' should be interpreted to mean a genuine relationship of parent and child, as opposed to a legal relationship of parent and child. However, the Board had consistently held that this phrase refers to the creation of a legal relationship of a parent and child and does not extend to a factual examination of the bona fides of the adoption.
"Therefore, the sole issue which the Appeal Division must determine is whether a legal relationship of parent and child has been created by operation of the foreign law. The court petition regarding the adoption of the applicant indicated that the requirements for adoption in the Philippines had been met. Based on the evidence the Appeal Division can only conclude that a legal relationship of parent and child has been created. Accordingly, the panel finds that the adoption does satisfy the definition of 'adopted', as contained in section 2(1) of the
Regulations
. The applicant is a member of the family class. Accordingly, the appeal pursuant to s. 77(3)(a) of the
Act
is allowed in law.
"
[11]
Section 2(1) of the
Regulations
, as it stood at the time applicable to these circumstances, provided as follows:
"'adopted' means adopted in accordance with the laws of any province of Canada or of any country other than Canada or any political subdivision thereof where the adoption created a relationship of parent and child.
"
[12]
The applicant submits that the tribunal erred in law in considering only the legal validity of the foreign adoption and in failing to assess the factual circumstances surrounding the adoption to determine that the adoption created a relationship of parent and child in accord with s. 2(1) of the
Regulations
.
[13]
In the applicant's view, the tribunal has an obligation to look beyond whether the respondent and Randy comply with foreign legal adoptions requirements, and it is required to assess whether that adoption created a relationship of parent and child. In determining whether a person is adopted within the meaning of the former s. 2(1) of the
Regulations
, one must, it is said, consider Canadian law to determine whether the relationship is one of parent and child. The applicant maintains that if, as the tribunal concluded, its only obligation is to enquire into whether the adoption laws of the foreign jurisdiction have been complied with, there would be no need to include the phrase "where the adoption created a relationship of parent and child" in s. 2(1) of the
Regulations
.
[14]
The respondent, representing himself, submitted that all legal requirements have been met in connection with the adoption and that it is bona fide. In the respondent's view, he and Randy Edrada have a parent and child relationship as is indicated by the facts that the respondent lived for a period of time with Randy in the Philippines, that he provided money for his support, that they had several long distance calls, that they wrote each to other and that he intends to leave a portion his estate to Randy. Moreover, he suggests that by the adoption he became the boy's father and thus he was his parent, as well as his grandparent. Finally, he urges that the
Act
is to be interpreted in accord with s. 3 which identifies among its purposes the need to facilitate the reunion in Canada of Canadian citizens and permanent residents with their close relatives from abroad.
[15]
In
Singh v. (Canada) Minister of Employment and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 1 (F.C.A.), the court noted that, in deciding whether an individual is adopted for the purposes of the
Act
, one must have regard not only to the law of the foreign jurisdiction, but to Canadian law as well. Mr. Justice Hugessen for the court stated:
"... the question in each case was to know whether there had been ... an adoption 'in accordance with the laws of' India which created a relationship of parent and child so as to make the adoptee the sponsor's 'son'. This is an issue of Canadian law. The inquiry is directed more to historical fact than to present status and the determination whether the
Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act 1956
has been complied with is only a part of the responsibility which Canadian legislation gives to the visa officer and the Board to decide whether an application for landing in Canada should be approved. Presumptions imposed by Indian law on Indian courts, in private international law terms, the status of the sponsorees in India, are of no assistance in determining if either of them qualifies as an 'adopted son' for the very special purposes of the
Immigration Act
...
"
[16]
My colleague, Mr. Justice Cullen, in
Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 4 (T.D.), in adopting
Singh
, stated that the Appeal Division of the Board must not look solely at whether there has been a valid adoption in accord with the laws of the foreign jurisdiction, but also at whether such an adoption is properly recognized under the
Act
and
Regulations
.
[17]
That approach was again adopted in
Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), where this court found that the determination of whether a parent and child relationship existed is a separate issue from the determination as to whether the adoptee had been adopted in accord with the laws of a foreign jurisdiction. In that case, Mr. Justice Wetston stated at p. 57:
"A parent and child relationship is not automatically established once the requirements of a foreign adoption have been demonstrated. In other words, even if the adoption was within the provisions of [the foreign law], whether the adoption created a relationship of parent and child, thereby satisfying the requirements of the definition of 'adoption' contained in subsection 2(1) of the
Immigration Regulations, 1978
, must still be examined."
[18]
In my view, the tribunal had a duty under then s. 2(1) of the
Regulations
, having found the foreign legal requirements for adoption were met, to determine whether the relationship of parent and child has been established between the adopting parent and the adoptee. The definition of "adopted" in s. 2(1) contemplates a two step process in which a determination must be made, first whether foreign adoption laws have been complied with, and second whether a relationship of parent and child is created.
[19]
In my opinion, if Parliament had intended that a determination whether an individual is considered to be adopted for the purposes of the
Act
and
Regulations
was to be based solely on compliance with the adoption laws of the applicable foreign jurisdiction, there would have been no purpose in including the phrase "where the adoption created a relationship of parent and child". That phrase, in my view, must be given meaning. In order to establish an adoption for the purposes of that definition, it is necessary to demonstrate the existence of a relationship of parent and child, in addition to compliance with applicable adoption laws.
[20]
In my view the tribunal here erred in law in finding that its determination of whether Randy had been adopted for the purposes of the
Act
and
Regulations
depends solely on whether or not the adoption laws of the Philippines were satisfied so that the legal relationship of parent and child was created by the adoption. The tribunal also had a responsibility to determine, on the facts presented, whether the adoption created, in fact, the relationship of parent and child between the respondent and Randy. The tribunal declined to consider that question, an issue essential under the
Act
and
Regulations
. In thus declining to consider the matter the tribunal erred in law.
[21]
The respondent here urged that he and Randy have a relationship of parent and child. That is not an issue for this court to determine on judicial review. It was not considered by the tribunal. The Immigration and Refugee Board is in the best position to make a determination on that matter, after having reconsidered all relevant evidence.
[22]
As noted by counsel for the applicant at the hearing of this matter, the issue arising in this case is one that may not recur frequently. I note that in 1993 the definition of "adopted" in s. 2(1) of the
Regulations
was amended by adding to the former definition the following limitation, "but does not include a person who is adopted for the purpose of gaining admission to Canada or gaining the admission to Canada of any of the person's relatives". Clearly, the purposes of an adoption will have to be considered in applying the
Regulations
as amended.
[23]
The application for judicial review is allowed and an order is issued setting aside the decision made November 24, 1994. The matter is referred back to the Immigration and Refugee Board for redetermination in accord with these reasons.
Appeal allowed.
