Simpson, J.
: In a decision dated February 22, 2007, the Minister of Health (the Minister) concluded (i) that the amendments to the
Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations
, S.O.R./93-133 (the
New Regulations
) changed the eligibility requirements for patents listed on the Patent Register and (ii) that the Applicants' patent did not meet those requirements. Accordingly, further to his obligation to maintain the Patent Register, the Minister de-listed the Applicants' patent (the Decision) even though it had been validly listed before the
New Regulations
came into force on October 5, 2006.
[2]
In this application for judicial review, the Applicants seek an order quashing the Decision and restoring their patent to the Patent Register.
PREVACID
[3]
PREVACID® is a drug used to reduce gastric acid secretions in the stomach and prevent infectious diseases caused by Helicobacter Pylori. The active medicinal ingredient in PREVACID® is lansoprazole. It is a compound used to treat gastric ulcers.
THE PATENT
[4]
Canadian Patent No. 2,269,053 (the 053 Patent) was filed in the Canadian Patent Office (the Patent Office) on November 13, 1997. On May 12, 2006, a Notice of Allowance was issued which meant that all the requirements for the issuance of the 053 Patent had been met. As well, by that date, the required fee had been paid. However, the 053 Patent did not actually issue until July 18, 2006.
[5]
The 053 Patent claims various methods for producing solvent-free lansoprazole crystals and the crystals themselves. There are also three claims related to the crystals' use in the treatment of ulcers. These use claims are the ones which are relevant in this case and are as follows: claim 10 claims a medicine comprising the solvent-free crystal for use as an anti-ulcer agent, claim 12 is for use of the solvent-free crystal for manufacturing a medicine for use as a anti-ulcer agent and claim 13 is for the use of the solvent-free crystal for treating or preventing ulcers.
[6]
On July 20, 2006, the Applicants submitted a patent list (the Patent List) for the purpose of listing the 053 Patent on the Patent Register in relation to a Supplementary New Drug Submission for PREVACID®. The 053 Patent was added to the Patent Register on July 25, 2006. All parties agree that the 053 Patent was properly listed under the
Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations
which then applied (the
Old Regulations
).
THE SUPPLEMENTARY NEW DRUG SUBMISSION
[7]
The Patent List was submitted in relation to Supplementary New Drug Submission (SNDS) number 066102 dated March 31, 2000. It was for a new use of lansoprazole in the treatment of ulcers caused by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). For this reason, SNDS 066102 will hereafter be described as the NSAID SNDS. The NSAID SNDS was entitled "New Indications: Healing of NSAID-Associated Gastric Ulcer and Reduction of Risk of NSAID-Associated Gastric Ulcer."
THE APPLICANTS
[8]
TAP Pharmaceuticals Inc. (TAP) is the party which files submissions and receives Notices of Compliance for PREVACID® products in Canada. However, TAP does not have a regulatory affairs department in Canada. For this reason, Abbott Laboratories Limited (Abbott Canada) acts as TAP's agent in Canada for all matters relating to TAP's submissions. In the case of PREVACID®, Abbott Canada acted as TAP's agent for the filing of the NSAID SNDS and the submission of the Patent List.
[9]
TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. (TAP Products) is a holding company for TAP. TAP Products is a joint venture between Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited and Abbott Laboratories. The latter is the American parent of the Applicant, Abbott Canada.
THE DECISION
[10]
By letter dated February 22, 2007, the Minister informed the Applicants that notwithstanding their representations to the contrary, the 053 Patent would be removed from the Patent Register pursuant to the Minister's authority to maintain the Patent Register under subsection 3(2) of the
New Regulations
. Several reasons were given for the Decision but only two were argued on this application.
[11]
First, the Minister said that the 053 Patent does not contain a claim to a changed use as required by paragraph 4(3)(c) of the
New Regulations
. The Minister's view is that, to be listed on the Patent Register against the NSAID SNDS, the 053 Patent must specifically mention the treatment of NSAID ulcers. Since the 053 Patent only refers to the treatment of ulcers generally it fails to meet the Minister's criterion.
[12]
Second, the 053 Patent was de-listed because it claims a polymorphic form of lansoprazole and, according to the
Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement
for the
New Regulations
SOR/DORS/2006-242 (the
RIAS
), patents claiming polymorphic forms are not eligible for listing on the Patent Register in relation to an SNDS. For this reason, the Minister says that patents which also claim uses of such forms are ineligible.
THE OLD AND NEW REGULATIONS
[13]
Attached as Schedule "A" to these reasons, is a chart which was used during the hearing to compare the
Old
and
New Regulations
. The following points of comparison are noteworthy:
(i) Subsection 3(1) in the
Old Regulations
and subsection 3(2) in the
New Regulations
deal with the Minister's obligation to maintain the Patent Register. The parties agreed that, for the purposes of this case, there are no material differences between the provisions.
(ii) The language used to describe the listing of the patents on the Patent Register has changed. The
Old Regulations
in subsection 3(3), and paragraphs 4(2)(b) and 4(7)(b) generally spoke of "including" patents on the Patent Register. In contrast, the
New Regulations
in subsections 3(5), (7), and 4(1), (2), (3) and 4.1(2) generally speak of "adding" patents to the Patent Register.
However, this usage is not entirely consistent because the sections dealing with maintaining the Patent Register in both the
Old
and
New Regulations
3(1) and 3(2) both refer to "adding" and "deleting" patents.
(iii) Subsection 4(3) in the
New Regulations
is entirely new. It provides only three situations in which a patent is eligible to be added to the Patent Register in relation to an SNDS. These provisions are referred to in paragraph 4(4)(f) of the
New Regulations
as the "eligibility requirements". It is paragraph 4(3)(c) that is relevant in this case.
STANDARD OF REVIEW
[14]
The parties agree that questions of interpretation of the
Old
and
New Regulations
are questions of law and that the Standard of Review is correctness. In this regard, see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 25.
THE ISSUES
[15]
Against this background, there are two broad issues. The first is whether the Minister had authority under the
New Regulations
to delete the 053 Patent in the course of maintaining the Patent Register. The second issue is whether the 053 Patent meets the eligibility requirements in paragraph 4(3)(c) of the
New Regulations
.
Issue 1 - Maintaining the Patent Register
[16]
This issue involves the proper interpretation of the
New Regulations
. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court reiterated the modern approach to statutory interpretation in the context of the
Notice of Compliance Regulations
. At paragraph 26 the court wrote:
"It is now trite law that the words of an Act and regulations are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the
Act
, the object of the
Act
and the intention of Parliament. Further, the scope of a regulation such as the provisions of the
NOC Regulations
is constrained by its enabling legislation, in this case s. 55.2(4) of
Patent Act
(
Biolyse
, at para. 38)."
[17]
The provisions at issue are subsection 3(2) and paragraph 4(3)(c) of the
New Regulations
and section 6 of the
Regulations Amending the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations
, SOR/2006-242 (the
Amending Regulations
).
[18]
Subsection 3(2) obliges the Minister to maintain the Patent Register. It states:
"3(2) The Minister shall maintain a register of patents and other information submitted under section 4. To maintain the register, the Minister may refuse to add or may delete any patent or other information that does not meet the requirements of that section."
"3(2) Le ministre tient un registre des brevets et des autres renseignements fournis aux termes de l'article 4. À cette fin, il peut refuser d'y ajouter, ou en supprimer, tout brevet ou tout autre renseignement qui n'est pas conforme aux exigences de cet article."
[19]
Paragraph 4(3)(c) provides the eligibility requirements for adding a patent to the Patent Register in relation to an SNDS for a changed use. It says:
"4(3) A patent on a patent list in relation to a supplement to a new drug submission is eligible to be added to the register if the supplement is for a change in formulation, a change in dosage form or a change in use of the medicinal ingredient, and
. . . . .
(c) in the case of a change in use of the medicinal ingredient, the patent contains a claim for the changed use of the medicinal ingredient that has been approved through the issuance of a notice of compliance in respect of the supplement."
"4(3) Est admissible à l'adjonction au registre tout brevet, inscrit sur une liste de brevets, qui se rattache au supplément à une présentation de drogue nouvelle visant une modification de la formulation, une modification de la forme posologique ou une modification de l'utilisation de l'ingrédient médicinal, s'il contient, selon le cas:
[. . . . .]
c) dans le cas d'une modification d'utilisation de l'ingrédient médicinal, une revendication de l'utilisation modifiée de l'ingrédient médicinal, l'utilisation ayant été approuvée par la délivrance d'un avis de conformité à l'égard du supplément."
[20]
Section 6 of the
Amending Regulations
is a transitional provision. It sets a cutoff date of June 17, 2006. Patent Lists submitted on or after that date are subject to the
New Regulations
. The section reads:
"6. Section 4 of the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations, as enacted by section 2 of these Regulations, does not apply to patents on a patent list submitted prior to June 17, 2006."
"6. L'article 4 du Règlement sur les médicaments brevetés (avis de conformité), édicté par l'article 2 du présent règlement, ne s'applique pas aux brevets inscrits sur la liste de brevets présentée avant le 17 juin 2006."
[21]
The Applicants' submissions on this issue were made under five headings. I will deal with each in turn.
The "Plain Meaning" Submission
[22]
The Applicants take the position that since section 4 of the
New Regulations
deals only with the eligibility requirements for
adding
patents to the Patent Register, it cannot be that the requirements in paragraph 4(3)(c) can be used in conjunction with the requirement to maintain the Patent Register in subsection 3(2) of the
New Regulations
when the Minister is considering
deleting
patents.
[23]
However, in my view, if this approach is taken, subsection 3(2) has no meaning when applied to the deletion of patents because there would be no requirements in section 4 that relate to deletions. In other words, the Applicants' interpretation does not fit within the scheme of the
New Regulations
which apparently intends subsection 3(2) and section 4 to interrelate on two subjects - both the addition and the deletion of patents.
[24]
At the hearing the Applicants emphasized that their interpretation did not eviscerate the Minister's power to maintain the Patent Register because the Minister could, for example, remove patents from the Register if a Drug Identification Number were cancelled, or if a patent expired or had been added in error, or if delisting had been ordered by a Court. However, the problem with this submission is that these situations are not referred to in section 4.
[25]
As <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> states at paragraph 26, provisions should, if possible, be construed to fit with the scheme of the
Regulations
. With that in mind, it is my view that the words of subsection 3(2), when read in their context and in their ordinary sense, have the effect of cross-referencing the requirements for adding patents in section 4 so that they also become the requirements for the deletion of patents under subsection 3(2).
The "Retroactivity" Submission
[26]
The Applicants say that the eligibility requirements for listing a patent on the Patent Register in relation to an SNDS in paragraph 4(3)(c) of the
New Regulations
cannot justify de-listing the 053 Patent because this involves a retroactive application of the
New Regulations
which is not authorized by section 55.2 of the
Patent Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4. For this proposition, see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), affd. [1994] 3 S.C.R. 1100; 176 N.R. 1, at paragraph 126.
[27]
I acknowledge that the
New Regulations
cannot have retroactive effect but I have also concluded that they have no such effect. In my view, the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(4th) 289 (F.C.A.) is directly on point. There Justice Sharlow, for the majority said this:
"[15] The 1998 amendments also made some changes to section 4 which narrowed the scope of information that is eligible for inclusion on the patent register. Counsel for Eli Lilly argued that the eligibility of any patent lists it submitted prior to the 1998 amendments should not be assessed under the narrower rules. I do not agree. In my view, the 1998 amendments entitle the Minister to delete from the patent register any information that does not meet the requirements of the
PMNOC Regulations
, as they are established from time to time by the Governor in Council. Thus, a patent that qualified for inclusion on a patent list in 1993, but does not qualify under the 1998 amendments, may be removed at any time after March 11, 1998.
"[16] I see no merit in the submission of counsel for Eli Lilly that this offends any right or presumptive right on the part of Eli Lilly not to be subject to retroactive legislation. The 1998 amendments are not retroactive. The 1998 amendments speak only from March 11, 1998. The fact that they properly may apply to cause the removal from the patent list of a patent that was accepted for listing in 1993 does not make the 1998 amendments retroactive ..."
[28]
The Applicants say that I should not accept <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> as a binding precedent because under paragraph 4(7)(b) of the
Old Regulations
, the Minister was considering whether patents qualified for "inclusion", i.e. both whether they could be added to and deleted from the Patent Register, while under subsection 4(3) of the
New Regulations
the Minister considers only whether patents can be "added" to the Register.
[29]
In my view, this submission is not persuasive. I am not satisfied that the words "include" and "add" are materially different. In the sections relied on by the Applicants both words involve the idea that a patent will be placed on the Patent Register. Paragraph 4(7)(b) of the
Old Regulations
deals with the contents of a patent list which is being prepared for submission and subsection 4(3) of the
New Regulations
deals with adding patents to the Register. Given these contexts, there is no basis for concluding that "include" has anything to do with removing patents from the Patent Register.
The "Vested Rights" Submission
[30]
The Applicants say that the Minister erred when he interpreted section 6 of the
Amending Regulations
to mean that paragraph 4(3)(c) of the
New Regulations
applied to all patents lists submitted after June 17, 2006 whether or not the patents had been listed on the Patent Register before the
New Regulations
came into force on October 5, 2006. The Applicants base this submission on the presumption against interference with vested rights. They say that they have a vested right to have the 053 Patent remain on the Patent Register so that it must be addressed by generic companies. As well, they submit they have a vested right to continue the prohibition action they commenced on November 23, 2006 in response to Apotex's filing a Notice of Allegation on September 27, 2006 with respect to the 053 Patent.
[31]
However, these submissions depend on the Applicants' alleged right to have the 053 Patent remain on the Patent Register and I have concluded that they have no such right in view of the Minister's obligation to maintain the Register under subsection 3(2) of the
New Regulations
.
The "Addressability" Submission
[32]
The Applicants suggest that the Minister's interpretation of subsection 3(2) of the
New Regulations
which allows him to delete patents which do not meet the eligibility requirements in section 4 is incorrect because it is inconsistent with the provisions of section 7 of the
Amending Regulations
. It is another transitional provision and it reads as follows:
"7(1) Subsection 5(1) of the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations, as enacted by section 2 of these Regulations, applies to a second person who has filed a submission referred to in subsection 5(1) prior to the coming into force of these Regulations and the date of filing of the submission is deemed to be the date of the coming into force of these Regulations.
"7(2) Subsection 5(2) of the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations, as enacted by section 2 of these Regulations, applies to a second person who has filed a supplement to a submission referred to in subsection 5(2) prior to the coming into force of these Regulations and the date of filing of the supplement is deemed to be the date of the coming into force of these Regulations."
"7(1) Le paragraphe 5(1) du Règlement sur les médicaments brevetés (avis de conformité), édicté par l'article 2 du présent règlement, s'applique à toute seconde personne qui a déposé la présentation visée à ce paragraphe avant l'entrée en vigueur du présent règlement, et la date de dépôt de cette présentation est réputée être la date d'entrée en vigueur du présent règlement.
"7(2) Le paragraphe 5(2) du Règlement sur les médicaments brevetés (avis de conformité), édicté par l'article 2 du présent règlement, s'applique à toute seconde personne qui a déposé le supplément à une présentation visé à ce paragraphe avant l'entrée en vigueur du présent règlement, et la date de dépôt de ce supplément est réputée être la date d'entrée en vigueur du présent règlement."
[33]
Essentially this provision means that, if before October 5, 2006 a generic company filed an abbreviated new drug submission, it would be deemed to be filed on October 5, 2006, thus requiring the generic to address all the patents on the Patent Register at that date. The Applicants say that this provision is meaningless if the 053 Patent is deleted.
[34]
I am not persuaded by this submission. In my view, section 7 is only sensibly read if it requires a generic to address all patents
properly
on the Register at October 5, 2006. The fact that the Minister may delete some patents listed before that date does not render the provision meaningless.
The "Delay" Submission
[35]
The Applicants are frustrated because, although they received a Notice of Allowance from the Patent Office dated May 12, 2006, the 053 Patent did not issue until July 18, 2006. This meant that they did not have the 053 Patent on June 17, 2006 which was the cut off date for submitting patent lists under the
Old Regulations
. In spite of this, they say that, based on the Notice of Allowance they had an accrued right to the 053 Patent before June 17, 2006 and the Patent List should therefore be treated as if it had been submitted on or before June 17, 2006.
[36]
I was not referred to any case law indicating that a Notice of Allowance creates any rights. Further, the Applicants' frustration is based on the conduct of the Patent Office. It has nothing to do with the Minister who is the respondent in this case. In these circumstances, I am not prepared to conclude that the Minister should deem the 053 Patent List to have been submitted before June 17, 2006 when the 053 Patent was not issued until July 18, 2006.
Issue 2 - Does the 053 Patent meet the requirements of paragraph 4(3)(c) of the New Regulations?
[37]
The Minister concedes that the NSAID SNDS was for a new use and that a Notice of Compliance had issued for that new use. However, the Minister says that the 053 Patent which includes three claims for the use of lansoprazole in the treatment of ulcers is not eligible for listing under paragraph 4(3)(c) of the
New Regulations
because it does not expressly claim the treatment of NSAID ulcers.
[38]
However, paragraph 4(3)(c) says that the 053 Patent is eligible to be listed on the Patent Register if it "contains" a claim for the new use, i.e. the treatment of NSAID ulcers. To address the question of whether the 053 Patent claims uses to treat NSAID ulcers, the Applicants adduced the evidence of two experts who they describe as informed and skilled readers of the 053 Patent. The Minister took no issue with their qualifications.
[39]
Dr. David Armstrong is a specialist in gastroenterology. He is a professor at McMaster University and Chief of Clinical Service in the Division of Gastroenterology for the Hamilton Health Sciences group of academic hospitals. He is familiar with the use of PREVACID® in the treatment of NSAID-associated gastric ulcers.
[40]
Dr. Armstrong reviewed the 053 Patent and at paragraphs 20 and 21 of his affidavit sworn on April 20, 2007, said the following:
"20. In my opinion, a skilled physician, on May 22, 1998, would have clearly understood the word 'ulcer', in claims 10, 12 and 13 to include and refer to NSAID ulcers and would certainly have known that the claims cover the use of the solvent-free crystal for healing NSAID-associated ulcers and reduction of the risk of NSAID associated ulcers. NSAID ulcers are a well-known type of ulcer. As of the relevant date, a skilled physician would readily know that an NSAID ulcer is a type of 'ulcer' included within the scope of claims 10, 12 and 13. There is no scientific reason nor is there anything the '053 patent to suggest to the skilled physician any meaning for the claims that would exclude NSAID ulcers, and no such meaning would be given.
"21. Indeed, the disclosure of the '053 Patent discusses the use of the solvent-free crystal as a medicine, as an anti-ulcer agent for treating or preventing ulcers (see page 14 lines 3-11). From this and the claims, a skilled physician would clearly understand that this patent is claiming a medicine and a new use for that medicine; namely, the use of that medicine as an anti-ulcer agent. A skilled physician would have no hesitation in concluding that this description includes NSAID ulcers. Similarly, from reading the claims in light of this disclosure, a skilled physician would understand that claims 10, 12 and 13 claim the use of the medicine (the solvent-free crystal of lansoprazole) for the treatment or prevention of NSAID ulcers."
[41]
Dr. Jerry Atwood is the Curators' Professor of Chemistry and Chair of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Missouri-Columbia. At paragraphs 23 and 24 of his affidavit sworn on April 23, 2007, he said:
"23. A skilled chemist would understand from reading the '053 patent that the term 'ulcer' as it is used in claims 10, 12, and 13 is not limited to any particular type of gastric ulcer. Instead, the term 'ulcer' would be read and understood by a skilled chemist as referring to all stomach ulcers.
"24. Thus, it is my opinion that a skilled chemist would interpret claim 13 as covering the healing and reducing the risk of stomach ulcers however caused. Similarly, it is my opinion that a skilled chemist would interpret claim 13 as covering any stomach ulcer, however caused."
[42]
In my view, it is consistent with the expert evidence to conclude that the 053 Patent is eligible to be on the Patent Register pursuant to paragraph 4(3)(c) of the
New Regulations
because it includes a claim to the new use of lansoprazole to treat NSAID ulcers.
[43]
However, the Minister had a second problem with the 053 Patent. He also considered it to be ineligible to be listed on the Patent Register in relation to the NSAID SNDS because the
RIAS
says that polymorphic forms cannot be listed against SNDSs.
[44]
The relevant passage at page 1518 of the
RIAS
reads as follows:
"The amendments to section 4 also formally confirm the right to list new patents on the basis of SNDS filings and introduce listing requirements governing that right. Under these requirements, a patent which had been applied for prior to the filing of an SNDS may be submitted in relation to that SNDS provided the purpose of the latter is to obtain approval for a change in use of the medicinal ingredient (i.e. new method of use or new indication), a change in formulation or a change in dosage form and the patent contains a claim to the formulation, dosage form or use so changed. This will protect and encourage legitimate and substantive incremental innovation of direct therapeutic application.
New patents claiming novel physical forms of the approved medicinal ingredient will not be eligible for listing in this manner
." (My emphasis)
[45]
While it is true that the 053 Patent includes claims for the polymorphic form of lansoprazole, it is my view that this fact does not disqualify it for listing under paragraph 4(3)(c) of the
Regulations
. All that provision requires is that the 053 Patent "contain" a claim for the changed use. As described in paragraph 5 above and as confirmed by the Applicants' experts there are three such claims in the 053 Patent. In my view, it is therefore eligible in spite of the fact that it also contains claims to polymorphic forms.
[46]
For these reasons, I have concluded that the 053 Patent meets the eligibility requirements in paragraph 4(3)(c) of the
New Regulations
and should not have been removed from the Patent Register.
JUDGMENT
[47]
THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that
- This application is allowed with costs.
- The 053 Patent is to be listed on the Patent Register under the
New Regulations
in relation to the NSAID SNDS. The listing is to be as of March 1, 2007 which was the effective date of its de-listing.
Application allowed.
