[1]
Rothstein, J.
: The issue in this case is whether information of a commercial nature concerning a third party, but in the custody or possession of a government institution acting as agent for the third party, is within the control of the government institution and is therefore subject to disclosure pursuant to s. 4(1) of the
Access to Information Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. A-1. Section 4(1) states:
"4(1) Subject to this Act, but notwithstanding any other Act of Parliament, every person who is
(a) a Canadian citizen, or
(b) a permanent resident within the meaning of the Immigration Act, 1976,
has a right to and shall, on request, be given access to any record under the control of a government institution."
[2]
The parties, their status in the context of the
Access to Information Act
and how this issue comes before the court are set forth in paras. 1 to 5 of the Agreed Statement of Facts:
"1. Canada Post Corporation ('CPC') is a federal Crown corporation established pursuant to the
Canada Post Corporation Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-10. CPC has the mandate to, among other things, establish and operate a postal service for Canada.
"2. CPC is not listed in Schedule 1 to the
Access to Information Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. A-1 (the '
Act
'). CPC is therefore not a 'government institution' within the meaning of that term in the
Act
. It is, accordingly, a 'third party' within the meaning of that term in s. 3 of the
Act
.
"3. Public Works Canada ('PWC') is a department of the government of Canada and is a 'government institution' within the meaning of that term in the
Act
.
"4. Mr. Duquette is a Canadian citizen who has made a request under s. 4(1) of the
Act
for access to certain documents.
"5. CPC believes that the documents to which Mr. Duquette has requested access are documents which are under its control, and not under the control of PWC, as that term is used in the
Act
, and that, accordingly, the
Act
cannot apply so as to require that the documents be disclosed. Mr. Duquette believes the documents are under the control of PWC and so the
Act
applies to require disclosure. CPC, PWC and Mr. Duquette have therefore agreed to ask the court to make an initial determination, on this agreed statement of facts, as to whether the documents in question are under the control of PWC within the meaning of the
Act
."
[3]
The relationship between Canada Post Corporation ("CPC") and the Minister of Public Works for Canada ("PWC") is set out in paras. 15-18, 20 and 22-24 of the Agreed Statement of Facts:
"15. Upon the coming into force of the
Canada Post Corporation Act
in 1981, the administration and control of all real property of or leased to Her Majesty in right of Canada of which the Post Office Department was the sole or principal tenant was transferred to CPC.
"16. All real property now owned or leased by CPC, including the properties to which the documents to which access has been requested relate, is under the administration and control of CPC.
"17. CPC has retained PWC to manage such properties and to provide related technical and professional services.
"18. CPC and PWC have entered into two agreements which govern their relationship:
(1) Comprehensive Realty Management and Services Agreement, dated August 30, 1984 (the '1984 Agreement'), as amended from time to time; and
(2) Grants in Lieu of Taxes Management Agreement, dated July 14, 1988 (the '1988 Agreement').
Documents in relation to CPC properties are kept by PWC pursuant to one or more of these agreements.
. . . . .
"20. In connection with the properties to which the documents to which access has been requested relate, PWC acts as CPC's consultant/service agent pursuant to clause 1.0(c) of the 1984 Agreement.
. . . . .
"22. Pursuant to clause 3.2 of the 1984 Agreement, CPC has instructed PWC, as its consultant/agent, on how to deal with information with respect to CPC leases, and contracting or project matters. A copy of the instructions is attached as Schedule G.
"23. The instructions require that under no circumstances is PWC to 'release information concerning any CPC lease to anyone without the prior written consent to CPC'.
"24. The instructions further require PWC, as CPC's consultant/agent, not to discuss or impart any information of any kind regarding CPC to anyone outside of PWC. PWC is to treat CPC matters as confidential business information of CPC."
[4]
The records in question are described in para. 26 of the Agreed Statement of Facts:
"26. The records in question in this matter relate to 280 Progress Avenue and 425 Milner Avenue, which, as noted in para. 7 above, are owned and leased, respectively, by CPC. The records are compiled by PWC, for their use, in the course of performing the property management and related services for CPC. The records include correspondence between PWC and third parties (generally, contractors) with respect to tenders and work to be performed, and memos and correspondence between CPC and PWC regarding decisions and approval of decisions with respect to work on the properties and PWC internal documents and memos relating to work done by PWC and CPC. Amongst these records are contracts, blueprints, specifications and tender documents. All of the records contain information concerning CPC facilities which are not open to the public and information in respect of which is not generally available."
[5]
The applicant submits that the relationship between CPC and PWC is that of principal/agent and, pursuant to such relationship, the records in question are under the control of CPC and not PWC. The applicant says that because the records in question are under the control of CPC and not PWC, s. 4(1) does not apply to the records and they are not subject to disclosure under the
Access to Information Act
.
[6]
Prior to dealing with the arguments raised by the applicant, I will comment on the status of the parties and the contractual relationship between them. In the material before me, mention was made of the fact that Mr. Duquette is a union representative of the Canadian Union of Postal Workers and that the CPC is a Crown Corporation but not a government institution under the
Access to Information Act
. Under s. 4(1) of the
Act
, the right of access to a record under control of a government institution belongs to Canadian citizens or permanent residents. No other qualification is specified in the
Act
. While at a policy level it may be argued that the right of access should be conditional, no conditions are specified in the
Act
. Perhaps CPC views Mr. Duquette in an adversarial role because of his association with the Canadian Union of Postal Workers but this is not a relevant consideration in deciding whether or not he is entitled to access to the records in question in this case. As long as he is a Canadian citizen or permanent resident, he is entitled to invoke s. 4(1) of the
Access to Information Act
.
[7]
That CPC is a Crown Corporation is also not a relevant consideration for purposes of the
Access to Information Act
. Section 3 of the
Act
defines a government institution:
"3. In this Act,
. . . . .
'government institution' means any department or ministry of state of the Government of Canada listed in Schedule I or any body or office listed in Schedule I;"
[8]
CPC is not listed in Schedule I to the
Act
. Therefore, its records are not subject to disclosure under the
Access to Information Act
. In this sense, it is in a position analogous to any private citizen or corporation insofar as this
Act
is concerned.
[9]
Third party is defined in the
Act
in s. 3:
"3. In this Act,
. . . . .
'third party', in respect of a request for access to a record under this Act, means any person, group of persons or organization other than the person that made the request or a government institution."
Since CPC is neither the person that made the request nor a government institution, it is clearly a third party.
[10]
PWC, as a department of the Government of Canada, is listed in Schedule I of the
Access to Information Act
. As such, it is a government institution as defined in the
Act
.
Contractual Relationship:
[11]
The Comprehensive Realty Management and Services Agreement dated April 30, 1984, between CPC and PWC provides in para. 1.0(c) that the parties acknowledge.
"(c) that the relationship of CPC to PWC is and will be that of principal/client to consultant/service agent in the provision of services and in the management of real property under the administration and control of CPC ..."
The relationship of principal and agent has been established by express agreement between CPC and PWC in respect of the management of CPC real property.
[12]
The provisions of this agreement relating to the maintenance and control of records as between CPC and PWC are subs. 5.2 and 5.3.
"5.2 PWC shall keep accurate books and records of account in respect of services performed for CPC under this agreement, and shall complete such statements of account for CPC as CPC may require from time to time.
"5.3 CPC may, at any reasonable time and with prior notice to PWC, enter PWC's premises to inspect any books and records of PWC relating to services performed under this agreement, to inspect any other documentation relating to such service, or to perform an audit of all books and records of PWC in relation to the performance of such services. PWC shall allow CPC to copy and take extracts from such books, records, and other documentation and shall assist CPC as requested."
Subsection 5.2 provides that PWC shall keep accounts, books and records of account in respect of services performed for CPC. Subsection 5.3 provides that CPC may inspect books and records of PWC or other documentation relating to services performed by PWC for CPC. It also states that PWC shall allow CPC to copy and take extracts from such books, records and documents.
[13]
The Grants in Lieu of Taxes Management Agreement dated July 14, 1988, provides, in respect of books, accounts and records relating to services provided by PWC to CPC under the Agreement:
"4.2 P.W.C. (Municipal Grants Division) shall keep separate and accurate books, accounts and records in respect of services performed by it hereunder for C.P.C.
"4.3 P.W.C. agrees that the books, accounts and records referred to in s. 4.2 shall be the property of CPC and shall be transferred to C.P.C. upon termination of this Agreement."
[14]
Pursuant to these provisions, books, accounts and records related to CPC shall be kept separate by PWC and shall be transferred to CPC upon termination of the Agreement. The books, accounts and records, are the property of CPC.
[15]
On April 28, 1989, E.C. Kriegler, Vice-President, Real Estate, of CPC wrote to R.S. Lafleur, Assistant Deputy Minister, Realty Services, Public Works Canada, as follows:
"It has come to our attention that PWC is proposing to embark on a policy of preparing and making available to the public a list of PWC leases.
"This issue is being addressed in a letter from Frank McCarthy (CPC) to Avrum Miller (PWC).
"The purpose of this letter is to reiterate the position of CPC that under no circumstances is PWC to release information concerning any CPC lease to anyone without the prior written consent of CPC."
[16]
On May 8, 1989, Mr. Lafleur responded to Mr. Kriegler:
"PWC will accede to your wish to not include CPC leases in any list to be made available to the public at large.
"From time to time, we receive specific requests for lease information from Members of Parliament and other governments and under no circumstances will we release any information on CPC leases without your prior written consent."
[17]
On September 18, 1989, an internal memorandum was circulated within PWC on the subject matter:
"Canada Post Corporation
Privacy of Information
relating to CPC matters
"
At p. 2 of the memorandum, the following appears:
"Stated simply, Public Works Canada is not to discuss or impart any information of any kind regarding CPC to anyone outside of Public Works Canada; in other words we, as agents of Canada Post, are to treat Canada Post Corporation matters as confidential business information of the Corporation, and in a manner consistent with Public Works Canada 'protected' category. This is a client/PWC arrangement only, and does not mean security clearance of employees handling CPC information."
[18]
This correspondence and memorandum emphasize the principal/agent relationship between CPC and PWC and the agreement between PWC and CPC that PWC, as agent, will treat all CPC information as confidential and not impart the information to anyone outside of PWC.
[19]
I am fully satisfied that the relationship between CPC and PWC is that of principal and agent and that the agency agreement contemplates that PWC will keep CPC information confidential. In the absence of overriding statutory provisions, PWC may not, of its own volition, disclose CPC information in its possession. For it to do so would place it in breach of the principal/agent agreement.
[20]
The question still remains, however, whether such an agreement, or the principal/agent relationship as such, precludes the operation of the
Access to Information Act
in respect of CPC information in the possession of PWC.
[21]
The scheme of the
Access to Information Act
is that all information under the control of the Government shall be subject to the right of access by the public unless it falls under one or more of the specific exemptions to disclosure stipulated by the
Act
. In addition to the exemption provisions (ss. 13 to 26), by virtue of ss. 68 and 69, the
Act
is made expressly not applicable to certain government information e.g. confidences of the Queen's Privy Council. Other than the exemption and non-application provisions, there are no other provisions in the
Act
which restrict its application to information under the control of a government institution.
[22]
With particular reference to this case, the
Act
does not state that it does not apply to information that is in the possession of a government institution acting as agent for a third party principal. The role of the government institution in acquiring or accumulating information is not an express consideration as to whether or not the information is subject to disclosure pursuant to the
Act
.
The Applicant's Arguments:
[23]
The applicant argues that a record that is in the possession of a government institution because of the principal (third party) agent (government institution) relationship is not under the control of the government institution. Because control is not defined in the
Access to Information Act
, the applicant has resorted to various interpretative aids to assist in the consideration of whether or not the term "record under the control of a government institution" used in s. 4(1) of the
Access to Information Act
contemplates records in the possession of the government institution acting as agent for a third party.
[24]
The applicant makes essentially four arguments:
(1) The definition of control according to its dictionary meaning connotes control in a proprietary sense and some dominance or direction over the thing in question. It is said this type of control resides with CPC and not PWC.
(2) The purpose of the
Access to Information Act
is to provide a right of access to government information. CPC information is not government information and therefore it should not be considered to be under the control of a government institution for purposes of the
Act
.
(3) The term control in the context of the
Access to Information Act
contemplates something more than mere possession. It is argued that PWC has only possession and not control of CPC information.
(4) Even if control is equated with possession, possession must mean legal and not just physical possession. It is argued that PWC does not have legal possession of CPC records.
(1) Dictionary Definitions Of "Control"
[25]
The applicant's first argument is that the definition of control according to its ordinary meaning connotes control in a proprietary sense and some dominance or direction over the thing in question. Various dictionary definitions are cited in support of this interpretation. For example,
Black's Law Dictionary
(6th Ed. 1990), defines control at p. 329:
"
Control
, n. Power or authority to manage, direct, superintend, restrict, regulate, govern, administer or oversee. The ability to exercise a restraining or directing influence over something.
"
Control
, v. To exercise restraining or directing influence over. To regulate; restrain; dominate; curb; to hold from action; overpower; counteract; govern."
I have considered these and other definitions cited by the applicant. I agree with the applicant that a principal, in a principal/agent relationship, usually exercises some form of control in the form of dominance or direction over an agent and, with reference to this case, as between CPC and PWC, direction over the confidentiality or disclosure or records. However, the definition of control also includes the authority to manage, direct, superintend, administer or oversee. An agent would have such power, at least to some degree, with respect to its records and documents including those it maintained or controlled for its principal. Section 5.3 of the 1984 Realty Management Agreement between CPC and PWC provides that CPC may inspect books and records of PWC relating to the Agreement. At any reasonable time and with prior notice, CPC is allowed to copy and take extracts from such records. The implication is that PWC has day-to-day managerial and administrative control over the records.
[26]
The dictionary definitions of "control" do not clearly lead me to the conclusion that, in this case, CPC has control, in the sense that word is used in the
Access to Information Act
, over the records in question and that PWC does not. What the dictionary definitions do suggest is that the term "control" is open to a wide variety of meanings depending upon the circumstances in which the word is used. For one purpose CPC may be said to have control while for another purpose PWC would have control of the records. Based on the dictionary definition of control alone, it might be possible to conclude that because PWC has some control over the records within the meaning of the term in its broad dictionary sense, the records are under its control and are therefore subject to disclosure under the
Access to Information Act
.
[27]
However, as stated by L'Heureux-Dubé (dissenting in the result) in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 409 S.C.R.:
"... dictionary definitions are all merely
suggested
meanings; the true meaning of the word must necessarily flow from its context within the entire statute."
I do not, in this case, find it appropriate to rely on a dictionary definition of the word "control" without anything more. I turn therefore to a consideration of the applicant's arguments respecting "control" in the context of the
Access to Information Act
.
(2) Purpose Of The Act
[28]
The applicant's second argument is that the purpose of the
Access to Information Act
is to provide a right of access to government information under the control of government institutions. Section 2(1) of the
Act
states:
"2(1) The purpose of this Act is to extend the present laws of Canada to provide a right of access to information in records under the control of a government institution in accordance with the principles that government information should be available to the public, that necessary exceptions to the right of access should be limited and specific and that decisions on the disclosure of government information should be reviewed independently of government."
The applicant says that government information is information that pertains "to the government and the workings of government". Information of CPC in the possession of PWC is not such information.
[29]
I agree with the applicant that the purpose of the legislation is to provide a right of access to government information. However, government information is not defined in the
Act
. While government information would certainly be information pertaining "to the government and the workings of government", nothing in the
Act
suggest that any other information in the possession of the government may not also be found to be government information for purposes of the
Act
. Indeed, s. 2(1) seems to suggest that government information means all information in records under the control of a government institution. If this interpretation is correct, then the focus is not on the term "government information" but rather on the word "control" which is of paramount importance.
[30]
According to the scheme of the
Act
, no information under the control of a government institution is excluded from the operation of the
Act
ab initio. Rather, all such information is included and then, if an exemption applies, the information is not disclosed.
[31]
For example, the
Act
clearly recognizes that information under the control of a government institution may be information provided by or related to a third party. Section 20(2) states:
"20(2) The head of a government institution shall not, pursuant to subsection (1), refuse to disclose a part of a record if that part contains the results of product or environmental testing carried out by or on behalf of a government institution unless the testing was done as a service to a person, a group of persons or an organization other than a government institution and for a fee."
[32]
Section 20(2) presupposes that information pertaining to the results of product or environmental testing is under the control of a government institution even though the testing was done and information gathered as a service to a third party for a fee. Such information would be subject to disclosure except for the exemption in s. 20(2). Such information is initially included before consideration of its exclusion from disclosure under s. 20(2).
[33]
The applicant relied on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , which was a personal injury case involving a statutory corporation to which the
Public Authorities Protection Act
of Ontario applied. Section 11 of that
Act
provided a limitation of six months to bring an action against an authority for breach of a public duty. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> it was argued that the six-month limitation period applied only to the public aspects of the Corporation's operations and not to the private aspects of its operations. Estey, J., stated at p. 283 S.C.R.:
"It therefore follows that the reference in s. 11 to 'any statutory or other public duty' applies in the context of s. 6(2) of the
Housing Development Act
to those aspects of the statutory powers and duties there established which have a public aspect or connotation, and does not comprehend those planning, construction and managerial responsibilities (to paraphrase s. 6(2)) which have a private executive or private administrative application or are subordinate in nature. To read the section otherwise would be to bring within the protective umbrella of the limitation imposed by s. 11 every aspect of the powers enunciated in s. 6(2) including operational matters, however insignificant in the spectrum of management activities for example, and would as already mentioned create different conditions of owner liability for two apparently similar housing facilities."
The applicant argues by analogy that the
Access to Information Act
should be read to exclude private or nongovernment information that happens to be in the possession of a government institution. While the analogy which the applicant wishes to advance has some appeal, I do not think it can apply in this case in view of the statutory language of the
Access to Information Act
. The
Act
operates notwithstanding any other
Act
of Parliament. Its scheme is to be wholly inclusive and then to allow for exemptions. This is not a case where, as in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , one interpretation would work an unintended hardship. In the case of the
Access to Information Act
, specific exemptions may justify confidentiality. There is therefore provision for a remedy for a third party such as CPC in the exemption sections.
[34]
The purpose of the
Act
, disclosure subject to limited and specific exemptions, supports nondisclosure of certain third party information in the possession of a government institution based on an exemption. It does not support the proposition that third party information in the possession of a government institution acting as agent for the third party is not subject to the
Act
at all.
(3) Control In The Context Of The Act Means More Than Possession
[35]
The third argument of the applicant is that control in the context of the
Access to Information Act
means more than possession. In support of this argument, the applicant argues that control contemplates the power to use and dispose of information as the purposes of the government institution dictate. The applicant further says that since the information in this case was not supplied to PWC by CPC, CPC may not be able to invoke the exemption in s. 20(1)(b) of the
Act
. The applicant also relies on Treasury Board Interim Policy Guide:
Access to Information Act and the Privacy Act
which provides at p. 9:
"
Under the control
: A record is under the control of a government institution when that institution is authorized to grant or deny access to the record, to govern its use and, subject to the approval of the Dominion Archivist, to dispose of it. Regarding the question of physical possession, a record held by an institution, whether at headquarters, regional, satellite or other office, either within or outside Canada, is presumed to be under its control unless there is evidence to the contrary. A record held elsewhere on behalf of an institution is also under its control."
Finally on this point, the applicant submits that the
Privacy Act
, in addition to using the word "control", speaks of information "held by a government institution" or "under the custody and control" of government institutions. Similar distinctions in wording are cited in provincial access to information legislation. The applicant says that "control" must therefore require something more than mere possession or custody.
[36]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), an access request was made for disclosure of audited financial statements of certain Indian bands that had been provided to the Federal Government pursuant to the
Indian Act
. The bands argued that since the financial statements were obtained by the Government in the context of a trust relationship with the bands, that they were not under government control. Jerome, A.C.J., recited the arguments and stated his conclusion at p. 150 F.C.:
"In his oral submissions, counsel for the Band expanded this position to argue that, since the information is governed by the trust relationship, it is not really 'under the control' of a government institution. The documents may be in the Department's possession, but they are not under government control unless government direction can be exercised over them. It is argued that such direction is not possible given the limited purpose for which they were provided and the fiduciary nature of the relationship between the parties.
"Some of the other applicants put the case more strongly. It was argued that the financial statements could not be considered 'government information' at all as they record the Bands' own revenues and capital. It was alleged that in the phrase 'government information', the word 'government' has a proprietary connotation. It follows, that the government may only grant access to records with which it has the legal authority to deal in its sole discretion. In this case, it is submitted, the information, like the funds it describes, belongs to the Bands, not the government. It therefore cannot be said to be 'government information'.
"The respondent replies that any record in the possession of a government institution is 'under its control' within the meaning of s. 4(1) because it is within the institution's power to produce. A narrow construction of the term, it is alleged, would be contrary to the spirit and intent of the
Act
, which are to foster disclosure and access to information. That Parliament intended a broad definition of the word 'control' can be seen from the care it took to exempt from disclosure those records under government control in which a specific strong interest lies against disclosure. In the words of the respondent's written submissions:
'The exemption of third party information, as set out in s. 20 addresses the concerns pertaining to information provided to the government in a trust relationship, strikes the balance between the interests in disclosure and "privacy" in the larger sense and sets the exact criteria to be applied in the decision-making process.'
"It is further submitted that, since the records in question were required by the Department and submitted by the Band to comply with various regulatory and statutory 'government' requirements, they should be considered 'government information'.
"I find I must agree with the respondent on this issue. While the Bands understandably find it repugnant that their private records could be made the subject of an access to information request, the fact remains that, because of the reporting requirements, copies of their financial statements are under government control. To limit the definition of 'control' in order to exclude them would be to set a dangerous precedent with respect to the interpretation of this relatively new
Act
. Fortunately, as the respondent points out, the applicants' concerns have been dealt with by Parliament in the exemption sections of the
Act
."
[37]
The applicant says that
Montana Band of Indians
is distinguishable because in that case, the fact that financial statements of the bands were in the possession or control of a government institution was pursuant to a statutory requirement of the
Indian Act
whereas, in the case at bar, there is no statutory provision governing the relationship between CPC and PWC.
[38]
The learned Associate Chief Justice appears to have confined his rationale for finding that the records in that case were under government control by reason of the statutory reporting requirement. However, he also observed that "to limit the definition of control to exclude them would set a dangerous precedent". Although this observation was obiter, it suggests support for a broader rather than a narrower definition of the term control in the
Access to Information Act
.
[39]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), the Canadian Football League submitted a brief to the Government of Canada containing information about the C.F.L. and proposed action involving possible legislation, appropriations or both. The material was submitted voluntarily but in confidence. In his decision, Strayer, J., stated at p. 485 F.C.:
"The CFL contends that because the document in question here was marked 'confidential' and its confidential nature was stressed to the Government at the time of its presentation to the Government, which presentation was voluntary and not mandatory, the document is not 'government information' within the stated purpose of the
Act
in s. 2(1) nor is it 'under the control of a government institution' as referred to in ss. 2(1) and 4(1).
"The plain meaning of the language employed in the
Act
does not suggest that 'information', 'government information', or 'record under the control' of the Government must be limited by some test as to how and on what terms the information or record came into the hands of the Government. That is the kind of qualification which the CFL is asking me to create. I can find no basis for doing so. The plain meaning of ss. 2(1) and 4(1) as quoted above is that the
Act
gives access, subject to many exceptions, to any record, or information in a record, which happens to be within the custody of the government regardless of the means by which that custody was obtained. That is surely the interpretation which is also most consistent with the purpose of the
Act
. The interpretation advanced by the CFL on the other hand, appears to be inconsistent with s. 20(1)(b) which it also relies on: that paragraph obviously assumes that 'confidential information supplied to a government institution by a third party' is prima facie within the definition of 'record' to which access would otherwise be available were it nor for the possible protection of this paragraph. In other words, this exception proves the rule that confidential material supplied by a third party to the Government can form all or part of a 'record under the control of a government institution'. It will be noted that the word 'supplied' in s. 20(1)(b) is not modified by any terms such as 'under compulsion'."
[40]
The dicta of Strayer, J., suggests that control includes custody. He rejects the argument that control is defined by any test as to how information comes into the hands of the Government. Indeed he concludes that the exemption from disclosure in s. 20(1) of the
Act
proves the rule that all information supplied to or coming into the hands of the Government is under its control.
[41]
I, too, cannot see in the
Access to Information Act
any express statement or inference that "control" in the
Act
is to be modified by some test as to how information is to be used by a government institution or the extent to which a government institution may dispose of it. Nor is there any indication that "control", as used in the
Act
, can be affected by a private agreement between a government institution and a third party. The scheme is that all information in the hands of the Government is subject to the
Act
except information expressly exempted.
[42]
It may be, as the applicant submits, that CPC may not be able to avail itself of the exemption provided in s. 20(1)(b) of the
Act
because the information in question was not supplied by CPC to PWC. It appears to me that the applicant is arguing that because resort to an exemption provision in the
Act
may not be had, the
Act
should be construed so as to exclude the information in question here from the operation of the
Act
entirely. The issue of the application of specific exemption provisions is not before me to decide in this case. Suffice it to say, whether or not an exemption may or may not be invoked, does not determine the question of the application of the
Act
.
[43]
I now turn to the Treasury Board
Interim Policy Guide
. I first note that the
Interim Policy Guide
was superseded by revised
Access to Information and Privacy Policies and Guidelines
. The excerpt cited by the applicant from the
Interim Policy Guide
now appears on p. 13 of the revised
Guidelines
in slightly changed wording:
"The term 'under the control of a government institution' means that an institution is authorized to grant or deny access to the record, to govern its use, and subject to the approval of the National Archivist, to dispose of it. A record that is in the possession of or held by an institution, whether at headquarters, regional, satellite or other office, either within or outside Canada, is presumed to be under its control unless there is evidence to the contrary. A record held elsewhere on behalf of an institution is also under its control. It should be noted that archival records held by National Archives are considered to be under the control of that institution. Personal or political papers of ministers dealing with constituency and other matters and ministerial records which do not relate to the administration or operation of the institution for which the minister is responsible are not deemed to be under the control of the institution for purposes of the
Access to Information Act
."
I do not see any material change to the meaning of the excerpt by the slight change in wording between the
Interim Policy Guide
and the revision. I accept that the
Guidelines
may be an aid to the interpretation of the
Access to Information Act
. I also recognize that the Guidelines represent only the opinion of the Treasury Board or its officials and that they are not binding on government institutions, applicants for access or the court.
[44]
The applicant says that the
Guidelines
define "control" as the authority to grant or deny access to a record, to govern its use and to dispose of it. He says that since such authority does not belong to PWC in this case, PWC does not have control of the CPC records in question. I accept that in this respect, the
Guidelines
set forth an approach to the definition of "control" in the
Access to Information Act
that supports the applicant's position.
[45]
However, the
Guidelines
go on to say that a record in the possession of, or held by, a government institution is presumed, in the absence of "evidence to the contrary", to be under its control. Of course, "evidence to the contrary" must be construed in light of the words of the
Access to Information Act
and the jurisprudence interpreting it, including
Montana Band of Indians
and
Ottawa Football Club
. Thus, "evidence to the contrary" could not for example, be based on how information came into the hands of a government institution or could not take the form of a contracting out of the
Access to Information Act
.
[46]
While for other purposes, the
Guidelines
may be useful, I do not find them of assistance in the consideration of the question of what constitutes control in the context of third party information in the possession of a government institution. In this respect I find the decisions in
Montana Band of Indians
and
Ottawa Football Club
to be more specific and instructive.
[47]
I now turn to the argument that the
Privacy Act
and provincial access statutes use the terms "held", "custody or control", and "possession" in addition to the term "control". The applicant suggests this must lead to the conclusion that control as used in the
Access to Information Act
must mean something narrower and does not contemplate "custody", "possession" or "held".
[48]
In
Re American Airlines Inc. and Competition Tribunal et al.
(1988), 89 N.R. 241; 23 C.P.R.(3d) 178 (F.C.A.), it was argued that the rights to make representations pursuant to s. 9(3) of the
Competition Act
did not include the right to call evidence. Reliance was placed on the fact that ss. 97 and 98 of the
Competition Act
, a statute in pari materia, referred to the making of representations
and
the calling of evidence. It was argued that because Parliament had considered it necessary to refer to the right to call evidence in addition to the right to make representations in ss. 97 and 98 of the
Competition Act
, the right to make representations must be construed narrowly and must exclude the right to call evidence. At p. 187 C.P.R., Iacobucci, C.J. (as he then was), stated:
"It may be, although I refrain from any formal holding on the matter, that Parliament, out of an abundance of caution, has added the 'calling of evidence' in ss. 97 and 98 to ensure that making representations is not interpreted narrowly by the federal and provincial boards and agencies before which the Director is appearing. In any event, I believe the main task of a court is in each case to ascertain the meaning of a specific section by looking to its wording and context. The fact that Parliament has chosen a formulation of words in another section of a related statute which appears to convey a particular meaning should not of itself displace convincing reasons why the same interpretation should not apply to the section in issue before the court. The point made about ss. 97 and 98 is, after all, a rule of interpretation that can be rebutted, and in this case has been, by more persuasive arguments."
In the case at bar, no explanation was provided as to why words such as "held by" or in the "custody or control" were used in the
Privacy Act
instead of the single word "control". It may be that such words were used in the
Privacy Act
for specific purposes or perhaps in an abundance of caution.
[49]
My task is to ascertain the meaning of the term "records under the control of a government institution" by looking to the wording and context of the
Access to Information Act
. I am satisfied there are convincing reasons based on the scheme of the
Act
and the dicta of Strayer, J., in
Ottawa Football Club
as to why the term contemplates records in the possession of a government institution. I therefore cannot agree with the applicant that the term "records under the control of a government institution" was intended to have a narrow meaning.
[50]
The applicant also relies on decisions of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal of British Columbia in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  L.J.S.C., on June 13, 1989, unreported, No. A-890925 Vancouver Registry. The decision of the Court of Appeal also unreported, was rendered on July 13, 1990, by Hutcheon, J.A., for the court, Vancouver Court of Appeal Registry, CA-011003.
[51]
In that case the City of Vancouver performed certain functions for the Province of British Columbia. Access to information pertaining to records collected by the City of Vancouver for the Province was sought from the City on the basis of a municipal bylaw that provided for access to information "held by the City". Vancouver bylaw No. 5591 entitled the
Freedom of Information and Privacy Bylaw
provided:
"2(1) Except as otherwise provided, every person has the right to receive, inspect and examine all information held by the City.
. . . . .
"2(3) If this bylaw conflicts with an enactment of the federal or provincial government, the federal or provincial enactment prevails."
[52]
The Province successfully argued that the information belonged to the Province and that Vancouver's bylaw did not apply to it. By analogy, the applicant here argues that the records of CPC do not belong to PWC and are not within the control of PWC.
[53]
However,
Pacific Press
was decided on the basis that the municipal legislation providing for access to information could only be effective within the scope and purpose determined for it by the province. Campbell, L.J.S.C., stated at pp. 6-7:
"I agree with the respondents in their submission that ownership is the central issue here. The City is a creature of provincial legislation and may only enact bylaws within the scope of the powers delegated to it by the province: Rogers,
The Law of Canadian Municipal Corporations
(2nd Ed.) s. 63.11. It would be contrary to its inferior legislative position for the City to be able to legislate so as to control access to documents under provincial jurisdiction or control, in the absence of any implied or express authority to do so ...
"While it is true that the inspections are carried out by City employees, and the record of those inspections stored on City property, the very fact that the duty to inspect is imposed by provincial legislation, and the medical health officer accountable in this respect to the provincial board, indicates that the enforcement of the
Act
and Regulations made under it remains a matter of provincial jurisdiction ... The mere use of municipal employees to perform a task on behalf of the province, or a provincial body, cannot be taken as impliedly expanding the legislative jurisdiction of the municipality."
[54]
This decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal. Hutcheon, J.A., stated at p. 3:
"With respect, I think the judge in chambers was correct in his conclusion that the documents in question are not records or documents of the City. The jurisdiction implicit in s. 168 [of the Vancouver Charter] to pass a bylaw relating to 'any record or document of the city' does not extend to documents that belong to the Board and are assembled for the purposes of the Board."
[55]
As I understand the decisions in
Pacific Press
, they say that since provincial law authorized the City to disclose documents "of the City", the City does not have jurisdiction to enact a bylaw providing for the disclosure of documents of the Province and not of the City.
[56]
No similar jurisdictional issue arises in the case at bar. There is no jurisdictional limitation on the Government of Canada which would restrict it from ordering disclosure of third party information. I therefore do not find the
Pacific Press
case applicable to the case at bar.
(4) Legal Possession
[57]
The applicant submits that in the context of discovery of documents in litigation, when possession is spoken of, actual corporeal possession is not meant. Rather, legal possession, meaning that a party is authorized to deal with the property, is contemplated. The applicant says that, although PWC has physical possession of CPC records in this case, it does not have legal possession. Therefore, by analogy, as discovery of the CPC records in this case would not be ordered in an action against PWC, neither should the
Access to Information Act
apply to such records.
[58]
Acceptance of this argument of the applicant requires acceptance of the analogy between discovery in litigation and access to records under the
Access to Information Act
. I am not satisfied that the analogy is valid. The purpose of discovery is to ascertain information in the knowledge and possession of a party adverse in interest. All relevant information is producible subject to certain exceptions, e.g. documents in the physical but not legal possession of an agent where the action is against the agent and not the principal.
[59]
The discovery process is adversarial in nature and relevancy is the predominant test for disclosure. Exceptions to production on discovery are guided by these considerations. By contrast, access under the
Access to Information Act
is not an aspect of an adversarial process and relevancy is not a consideration. It is the public interest in disclosure and not the private interest of litigants that is at the foundation of the
Access to Information Act
. There are many exemptions justifying confidentiality under the
Access to Information Act
that would not be available in the discovery process.
[60]
Under the
Access to Information Act
, confidentiality may be justified if, for example, disclosure would result in the release of trade secrets of the government (s. 18(a)), personal information (s. 19(1)), trade secrets or financial information of a third party (s. 20(1)), or internal government advice to a Minister (s. 20(1)(a)). These are not reasons for nondisclosure in the usual discovery process. Information that may be a trade secret or financial information of a third party or advice from one employee in a company to another, would have to be disclosed if relevant to the litigation. The difference is, that while under the
Access to Information Act
the obligation to disclose may be broader than in the case of discovery, the exemptions are different and, in some respects, more extensive. (Sections 37 to 39 of the
Canada Evidence Act
provide for nondisclosure in the discovery process where the government is involved based on public interest reasons. However, the analogy relied upon by the applicant is between the
Access to Information Act
and the usual discovery process. In assessing the analogy advanced, public interest reasons for nondisclosure under ss. 37 and 39 of the
Canada Evidence Act
would not be relevant.)
[61]
In my view, one is inevitably drawn back to a consideration of the purpose and context of the
Access to Information Act
in considering whether or not there must be disclosure of information in the hands of a government institution acting as agent for a third party. Strayer, J., in
Ottawa Football Club
has found that the manner in which information comes into the possession of a government institution is not a consideration in deciding whether or not the information is subject to disclosure under the
Act
. I would follow that approach and find that the considerations for disclosure and confidentiality under the
Access to Information Act
constitute a code in themselves which cannot properly be interpreted by reference to considerations in the discovery process. In my view, the fact that a government institution has possession of records, whether in a legal or corporeal sense, is sufficient for such records to be subject to the
Access to Information Act
.
Conclusion
[62]
Although I have not made express reference to the arguments of counsel for the respondent in these reasons, I have relied on the submissions made by him to a significant extent.
[63]
The application is dismissed with costs.
Application dismissed.
