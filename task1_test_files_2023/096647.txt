Martineau, J.
: H. Lundbeck A/S (H. Lundbeck) is a pharmaceutical company focusing on the treatment of disorders of the central nervous system. Lundbeck Canada Inc. (Lundbeck Canada) is the Canadian subsidiary of H. Lundbeck, which is the owner of Canadian patent no. 1,334,452 entitled
Enantiomers of Citalopram and Derivatives Thereof
granted on September 9, 1997 (the '452 patent).
[2]
With the consent of H. Lundbeck, the '452 patent was placed on the patent register by Health Canada. Lundbeck Canada and H. Lundbeck (collectively Lundbeck) are now seeking a protective order in this proceeding which was commenced pursuant to the
Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations
, SOR/93-133 (the
NOC Regulations
).
[3]
Genpharm Inc. (Genpharm) is a Canadian generic pharmaceutical company that is a member of the Merck Generic Group. Genpharm has filed with the Minister of Health (the Minister) an Abbreviated New Drug Submission (ANDS) for the issuance of a Notice of Compliance (NOC) for the medicinal ingredient escitalopram (oxalate) in tablet form for oral administration in each of 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg strengths (the Genpharm Products). The ANDS compares the Genpharm products with, or makes reference to, the drug CIPRALEXÂ® for which NOCs have been issued to Lundbeck Canada. The Notice of Allegation and Detailed Statement (NOA) served by Genpharm alleges that the '452 patent is invalid.
[4]
In the United Kingdom, Generics UK Ltd. (Generics UK) instituted proceedings against H. Lundbeck to have the patent corresponding to the '452 patent declared invalid. In Australia, Alphapharm PTY Ltd. (Alphapharm), also owned by the Merck Generics Group, instituted proceedings against H. Lundbeck and Lundbeck Australia PTY Ltd. to have the patent corresponding to the '452 patent declared invalid. Confidentiality agreements have been executed by the parties involved in the UK and Australian proceedings.
[5]
The general principle that the courts and their process should be open to public scrutiny, including the principle of public access to court documents, is fundamental to our system of justice. Accordingly, a protective order should only be granted when it is necessary to prevent a serious risk to an important interest, including a commercial interest, in the context of litigation, because reasonable alternative measures will not prevent the risk:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 53.
[6]
Protective orders are commonly requested, and granted, in proceedings under the
NOC Regulations
. In endorsing the principle that conidential orders can issue in proceedings under the
NOC Regulations
and in crafting their terms on an ad hoc basis so as to restrict their application to what is strictly necessary in any given case, this Court has attempted to strike a balance between the need for public scrutiny of the court process and the interests of justice between the parties, including the bona fide proprietary and commercial interests of the parties (see:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(4th) 149 (F.C.A.), at para. 6 (F.C.A.) (
AB Hassle
)).
[7]
It is a sufficient demonstration of the need for a confidentiality order if the moving party believes that its proprietary, commercial and scientific interests would be seriously harmed (
Apotex Inc. and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 305 (T.D.), at 311  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (
Wellcome Foundation
)). Protective orders are often granted on consent. As Justice Roger Hughes stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.), at paragraph 8, "[i]t is only when the parties disagree that this Court is asked to provide its view as to an appropriate form of order".
[8]
In its NOA, Genpharm agreed that were a proceeding to be commenced in response to the NOA, it would produce the relevant portions of its ANDS subject to the terms and conditions of an appropriate confidentiality agreement, an issue which is not contentious in the present proceeding. Lundbeck also expects to file documents already disclosed during the course of the UK and/or Australian proceedings, as well as documents and information which have not been disclosed. Based on the present evidentiary record, I am satisfied that these various documents include scientific information that is confidential and proprietary, as well as commercial and financial information that need to be protected from public disclosure.
[9]
The only contentious issue is to whom the information described by Lundbeck as being confidential ought to be divulged for the purposes of the present proceeding.
[10]
First, with respect to the filing of documents already disclosed during the course of the UK and/or Australian proceedings, Lundbeck simply requests that those documents be afforded the same protection as that given to them in the UK and/or Australia. This is certainly a valid consideration for the issuance of a protective order, which does not need to be perfectly reciprocal as between the parties in every respect (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 51 (
Rivard Instruments
)). Pursuant to the terms of the Lundbeck draft order, such confidential information may nevertheless be divulged to a number of "designated persons", which include Genpharm, the outside counsel for Genpharm, namely Osler Hoskin & Harcourt LLP (Osler), litigation contractors retained by Osler, up to seven individuals retained as outside experts by Genpharm, three employees of Generics, namely Howard Rosenberg, Paul Jenkins, and Shazia Khan, and outside counsel for Generics, namely the UK law firm of Taylor Wessing (Taylor).
[11]
Second, the Lundbeck draft order creates a category of "restricted confidential information" that includes all information that has not been disclosed in parallel proceedings in other jurisdictions. Lundbeck proposes that such information only be divulged to the "designated persons" mentioned above, but which will exclude Genpharm, Generics and Taylor.
[12]
According to the evidence on record, Peter Eustace, Senior Patent Officer of Genpharm, has primary responsibility for instructing Osler in this proceeding. Peter Eustace in turn reports to, and receives instructions from, Howard Rosenberg, an employee of Generics, and Group IP and API Strategy Director for the Merck Generics Group as a whole. Mr. Rosenberg has overall responsibility for managing the intellectual property litigation of Merck Generics Group, including this proceeding. Paul Jenkins, Group Manager - Patent and IP Strategy, and Shazia Khan, Patent Officer, are also employees of Generics, and work with Mr. Rosenberg on various proceedings involving members of the Merck Generics Group, including proceedings involving escitalopram.
[13]
Genpharm takes issue with the above category of "restricted confidential information". It submits that Genpharm, Generics and Taylor should be allowed to instruct Osler in this proceeding. Moreover, employees of Generics should have access to confidential information, provided that proper undertakings to utilize the confidential information
solely
for the purpose of the present litigation are executed by the concerned individuals. Counsel submits that Genpharm, Generics and Taylor are sophisticated parties, accustomed to dealing with confidential information. Moreover, any such information should not be limited to the three employees of Generics designated in the draft Lundbeck order.
[14]
"Counsel's eyes only" protective orders are not uncommon, but they are not granted by this Court in the exercise of its discretion as a matter of convenience. It has been stated in a number of decisions that such an order should only be granted in "unusual circumstances" (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 176 (T.D.) at 179  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> );
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 5 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )). There is no definition as to what constitutes "unusual circumstances". Each case turns on its own merits, bearing in mind that protective orders are in nature interlocutory and can be varied by the Court.
[15]
In
Wellcome Foundation
, above, at page 311  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Andrew MacKay took into account three considerations: the existence of a similar order granted upon consent in parallel litigation elsewhere; the possibility for a party to object to a designation of confidentiality and the Court's power to control the "declassification" process; and a party's belief that its commercial business or scientific interest associated with trade secrets might be seriously harmed by disclosure. These considerations were also applied in other decisions of this Court also dealing with requests for "counsel's eyes only" provisions (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at 180-181 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras. 8-10).
[16]
However, Justice MacKay did not purport to set out a series of criteria to be examined and followed in every instance ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 5) and the Court may see fit to consider and apply other relevant factors in addition or in substitution to the considerations mentioned in the
Wellcome Foundation
case. Indeed, where the parties themselves are competitors, preventing disclosure to the opposing party is a perfectly legitimate purpose of a protective order, particularly where the evidence shows that the disclosure to the opposing party could injure the interests of the other party (
Rivard  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para. 40). That being said, these considerations apply in this case which also involves the particular or special features addressed below.
[17]
First, I note that the confidentiality agreement executed in relation to the UK proceeding does not contain "counsel's eyes" provisions. However, the confidentiality agreement executed in relation to the Australian proceeding was subsequently modified by the Australian Court to include one lawyer of Alphapharm, giving him access only to certain particular documents. That being said, I doubt the impugned provisions of the Lundbeck draft order qualify as "counsel's eyes only" since outside experts are not excluded. In any event, based on the evidence on record, I find that Lundbeck has met the initial burden of proving that a protective order containing "counsel's eyes only" provisions in the case of undisclosed "restricted confidential information", should issue.
[18]
Second, the Lundbeck draft order ensures that the sensitive confidential information of the parties will not be disclosed or made use of for any other purpose than this application, and at this stage, based on the present evidence, I am satisfied that Genpharm, who is represented by outside counsel, namely Osler, will be able to prepare its case, further considering that the Lundbeck draft order provides that up to seven individuals not employed by Genpharm may be retained as outside experts. The bald assertion that Osler will need to send or to show the "restricted confidential information" to Genpharm, Generics and/or Taylor in order to get instructions is not persuasive.
[19]
Third, I am satisfied that the disclosure of the "confidential information" and "restricted confidential information" would create potential harm if divulged to persons other than the "designated persons" in the Lundbeck draft order. I accept that such confidential information is valuable to any competitor seeking to fine-tune a process for the production of escitalopram. Such competitor may gain a competitive advantage in knowing the sales and marketing strategy of Lundbeck. If disclosure of these undisclosed documents to Genpharm, Genpharm and/or Taylor were permitted, valuable commercial information helpful to these companies would come to be known by their employees who may unwittingly and unintentionally misuse that information at some future time in a fashion undetectable by Lundbeck and in respect or which there could be no adequate remedy.
[20]
Fourth, the parties themselves may challenge the true confidentiality of specific documents by the very terms of the Lundbeck draft order and this Court will always be prepared to hear challenge by a third party, such as Generics, whether or not the terms of the order so provide (
AB Hassle
, above, at para. 7).
[21]
Fifth, Generics is not a party to this proceeding, and Taylor is not counsel on record of Genpharm. While the terms of the proposed undertakings appear to have worldwide application, it is difficult to determine to what extent this Court can ensure that they are complied with and enforced outside Canada (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). It must be remembered that the failure to respect an order of this Court may lead to contempt proceedings. When a person is found guilty of contempt, imprisonment may be ordered by this Court. The difficulties with respect to the actual enforcement of the protective order outside Canada forces this Court to be very prudent at this point in time.
[22]
Sixth, nothing prevents Genpharm or any interested party from seeking in the future, in the case of certain identifiable confidential documents, more permissible conditions of disclosure on the basis of specific allegations supported by proper evidentiary material and reasonably enforceable conditions outside Canada, as the case may be.
[23]
In conclusion, having read the parties' respective draft orders and considered the evidence on record, as well as all relevant factors, I have decided to allow the present motion and issue a protective order in the form set out in the Lundbeck draft order (tab 2 of the motion record filed on behalf of Lundbeck). Costs associated with the present motion shall be in the cause.

1. The motion is allowed and a protective order in the form set out in the Lundbeck draft order, which is annexed as Schedule A, shall issue.
2. Costs associated with the present motion shall be in the cause.
Application allowed.
