Manson, J.
: This is an application for judicial review by Ms. Tania Zulkoskey [the Applicant] of a decision of the Canadian Human Rights Commission [CHRC or Commission] dated November 12, 2014, deciding not to deal with her human rights complaint on the basis that it was "vexatious" within the meaning of paragraph 41(1)(d) of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
, RSC 1985, c H-6 [
CHRA
or the
Act
]. Her complaint argues that providing a single set of Employment Insurance [EI] parental benefits to parents of twins is discriminatory under the
CHRA
.
I.
Background
[2]
The Applicant and her spouse paid EI premiums for many years. In 2008, the Applicant became pregnant through artificial insemination. She applied and was approved for EI sickness and maternity benefits in June 2009. On July 10, 2009, she gave birth to twins.
[3]
In a letter dated July 22, 2009, the Applicant requested that she be permitted to collect 15 weeks of maternity benefits and have the remaining 35 weeks of parental benefits transferred to her spouse. The request was approved.
[4]
On September 29, 2009, the Applicant and her spouse requested by letter that they both receive 35 weeks of EI parental benefits. The EI Commission denied her claim on the basis that her spouse had already been awarded the maximum EI parental benefits under the
Employment Insurance Act
, SC 1996, c 23 [
EI Act
], which provides one set of benefits per pregnancy.
[5]
The Applicant appealed this decision to the Board of Referees [the Board], which was denied on June 15, 2010, and then further to the Office of the Umpire [the Umpire]. The question at these appeals was interpretive: whether the Applicant was entitled to parental benefits under the
EI Act
or not.
[6]
Upon consent of all parties, the Applicant's appeal to the Umpire, along with a number of similar appeals, was stayed pending the final outcome of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Martin
], as they all shared a common question of law; whether parents of multiple-child pregnancies or adoptions were only entitled to 35 weeks of benefits per pregnancy or adoption, rather than 35 weeks per child.
[7]
Mr. Martin, a parent to twins born in 2009, requested and was denied EI parental benefits beyond those granted to his spouse. Mr. Martin had gone through the same appeals process as the Applicant, and was unsuccessful on his two grounds of appeal on judicial review at the Federal Court of Appeal  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The FCA determined that the impugned
EI Act
provisions award 35 weeks per single pregnancy or multiple-adoption and do not provide for an additional set of benefits in the case of twins or multiples. They further found that these provisions are not discriminatory under subsection 15(1) of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
, Part I of the
Constitution Act, 1982
, being Schedule B to the
Canada Act
1982 (UK), 1982, c 11) [the
Charter
]. The Supreme Court denied leave to appeal on June 27, 2013.
[8]
Initially, the Applicant had proposed that the result and reasons in
Martin
be binding on her case, as her appeal "arises from virtually the same set of facts" as
Martin
and seeks the same relief. The Umpire did not adopt this proposition, but simply granted the stay without further conditions, stating that "[o] nce the Martin case has been finally determined, [the Applicant] will have the opportunity to take the appropriate legal steps".
[9]
All appeals before the Umpire were transferred to the new Social Security Tribunal, Appeal Division [SST-AD]. On September 25, 2014, the SST-AD dismissed all outstanding appeals stayed pending the outcome in
Martin
, stating that the issue of parental benefits and multiple-child pregnancies or adoptions under the
EI Act
was now settled law.
[10]
The Applicant did not seek judicial review of the SST-AD's decision.
[11]
On October 10, 2013, the Applicant filed a human rights complaint with the CHRC, alleging that the one-benefit-per-birth cap under the
EI Act
was discriminatory on the basis of family status under the
CHRA
.
[12]
The CHRC requested that the Applicant provide submissions regarding whether paragraph 41(1)(d) of the
CHRA
applied [the Position Letter]. This provision directs that the Commission is not to deal with a complaint that is "trivial, frivolous, vexatious or made in bad faith". A vexatious claim arises where the complaint has been dealt with through another process. The letter detailed that a Section 40/41 Report [the Report] would be prepared by an Early Resolution Advisor [the investigator], which the CHRC would use "as well as the complaint form and any of the parties' submissions to the report, to decide whether to deal with the complaint". The letter provided instructions on how to prepare a position letter and what it should address.
[13]
The Applicant's Position Letter emphasized that her prior
EI Act
complaint and appeals solely concerned interpretation of the impugned provisions, but did not deal with her human rights issues. She thus did not have her day in court. The Respondent's position was that the substance of the Applicant's discrimination claim was conclusively decided in
Martin
; the Applicant and Mr. Martin's claims were nearly identical and consequently, she should not be given an opportunity to relitigate an issue found unsuccessful in another forum.
[14]
The Section 40/41 Report issued August 22, 2014, summarized the complaint, the parties' position letters and the
Martin
decision. It also outlined the applicable case law and legal tests and recommended that the complaint be dismissed as vexatious. The parties were provided an opportunity to respond, within a 10-page limit [response submissions].
[15]
The Applicant responded to the Report on September 22, 2014. Her response submissions refer to her Position Letter in an aim to demonstrate that the Report's findings were inaccurate regarding the scope of the
EI Act
appeals.
[16]
On October 3, 2014, the CHRC provided the parties with copies of each other's response submissions, to which they were given an opportunity to respond to the other party's submissions [cross-disclosure submissions]. Both parties did so.
[17]
On November 12, 2014, the Commission decided not to deal with the complaint, pursuant to paragraph 41(1)(d) of the
CHRA
[the Decision]. Within its reasons, the Commission indicated that it relied the following documents in arriving at its Decision:
a) the Complaint Form, dated October 10, 2013;
b) the Section 40/41 Report, dated August 22, 2014;
c) response submissions from the Applicant (received September 30, 2014) and the Respondent (dated September 19, 2014); and
d) cross-disclosure submissions from the Applicant (dated October 8, 2014) and the Respondent (dated October 23, 2014).
[18]
The Commission adopted the recommendations from the Section 40/41 Report, and provided reasons for their Decision, issued November 12, 2014, as follows:
a) the Applicant had exhausted other redress procedures available to her: a final decision was issued on September 25, 2014, by the SST-AD, which has the authority to decide on human rights issues;
b) essentially the same allegations of discrimination as the current complaint had been decided by the FCA decision in
Martin
, which determined that the parental benefits sections of the
EI Act
did not infringe section 15
Charter
rights;
c) using the result of
Martin
to preclude this complaint would not result in unfairness or injustice (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Penner
]): although tests under the
Charter
and
CHRA
are different, a human rights analysis of the claim under the
CHRA
would, similar to the
Charter
analysis in
Martin
, examine whether the complainant suffered adversity based on a ground of discrimination and consider the purpose of the
EI Act
parental benefit; and
d) based on guidance from the Supreme Court, the Commission determined it should not deal with the present complaint (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
Penner
, above).
II.
Issues
[19]
The issues are
:
A. Did the CHRC provide adequate procedural fairness to the Applicant in the circumstances?
B. Was the CHRC's decision reasonable?
III.
Standard of Review
[20]
The standard of review for determining procedural fairness is correctness and is reasonableness in reviewing the Commission's decision under subsection 41(1) of the
CHRA
not to deal with the Applicant's complaint (
Canada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[21]
The parties disagree on the level of deference owed to the Commission on applying the standard of reasonableness under subsection 41(1) of the
CHRA
.
[22]
The range of acceptable outcomes varies with the context. The Applicant argues that there is a narrower margin of appreciation where the possible outcomes are constrained (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> leave to appeal denied, 2013 CarswellNat 729 (SCC) [
Abraham
]). In the present case, the CHRC decided between one of two opposing outcomes - to deal with the complaint or not - thus, the Court should engage in a more exacting review of the decision (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
CHRC, 2013
]).
[23]
A reasonableness review is concerned with whether the Commission's decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes, and whether the decision is justified, transparent and intelligible. The Court must assess both the reasons given by the decision-maker and the result reached (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[24]
The language of the statute, which confers discretion on the Commission to decline to deal with a complaint, along with the nature of the Commission's role as a screening rather than adjudicative body, suggest the Commission is entitled to a higher level of deference under subsection 41(1) (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; aff'd
Love,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[25]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], Justice David Stratas found that decisions made under paragraph 41(1)(d) are deferential wherein the Commission considers several fact-based or "factually-suffused questions of mixed fact and law," in coming to its determination, which warrants greater deference from the Court.
[26]
Further, under subsection 41(1) the Commission is performing a factual and policy-based screening relating to the allocation of resources at the CHRC - not an adjudicative role. The Decision is based on the principles of fairness and consistency in decision-making, which aims to prevent the re-adjudication of matters adequately determined in another forum. The Commission should thus be afforded "great latitude" upon review ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 45).
[27]
The wording of paragraph 41(1)(d) provides the Commission with discretion to decline to deal with a complaint, stating that "the Commission shall deal with any complaint filed with it unless in respect of that complaint
it appears to the Commission that
...(d) the complaint is trivial, frivolous, vexatious or made in bad faith" [emphasis added]. This suggests Parliament intended the Commission be seized with this task and higher deference is to be afforded (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[28]
As stated by Justice Kane in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] (aff'd, 2015 FCA 99):
47 ...section 41 of the Act confers on the Commission ample discretion to decide when not to deal with a complaint at this preliminary stage (
Maracle
, supra at para 47). Decisions made pursuant to section 41 of the Act are, therefore, accorded significant deference by a reviewing court and accordingly, the scope of judicial review is narrow.
IV.
Analysis
A. Did the CHRC Provide Adequate Procedural Fairness to the Applicant?
[29]
The Applicant argues she was not afforded procedural fairness when the CHRC chose not to review her Position Letter, despite stating it would. As well, she claims the reply limit of 10 pages to the Section 40/41 Report was procedurally unfair.
[30]
In applying the
Baker
factors to determine the amount of procedural fairness owed in the circumstances, the Applicant argues that the Decision is important, as it engages her legal responsibility to provide for her children and effectively precludes her from having her day in court. She had a legitimate expectation that the CHRC would review her Position Letter. The Decision was a quasi-judicial administrative one, and should encompass basic elements of procedural fairness, including an opportunity to canvass her position and evidence fully, and have it considered by the decision-maker (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
Air Canada
], the FCA found a breach of procedural fairness partly by the way in which the "game-plan" for adjudication, namely who would carry the burden of proof, had been communicated.
[32]
The Applicant analogises
Air Canada
to the present facts: letters from the CHRC to the Applicant stated that the Commission would make a decision based on the Section 40/41 Report, the complaint form and any of the parties' submissions to the Report. She claims to have had a legitimate expectation that the CHRC would review her Position Letter, and referenced them in subsequent replies to the Report.
[33]
In assessing the
Baker
factors, I agree that the Applicant was owed a duty of fairness in the circumstances: the CHRC's decision affected the Applicant's rights, privileges and interests.
[34]
The first two
Baker
factors point towards a lesser degree of procedural fairness. The nature of the decision at the screening stage falls on the administrative end of the spectrum, as the determination is not made in an adversarial context. Additionally, the statutory scheme does not include a privative clause and judicial review is available for the Commission's screening decision.
[35]
The Commission's Decision at the screening phase is of considerable importance to the Applicant. The decision to dismiss her complaint will effectively preclude the Applicant from having her day in court and obtaining relief under the
Act
: it is therefore determinative of her rights. This
Baker
factor suggests an increased level of procedural fairness.
[36]
The fourth
Baker
factor considers the legitimate expectations of the Applicant, where the Commission undertook to follow a certain procedure. A review of the correspondence suggests that the Commission did not make a clear and unequivocal promise to review the Applicant's Position Letter. In the first letter to Ms. Zulkoskey, dated November 22, 2013, regarding the applicability of paragraph 41(1)(d), the Commission states:
The Commission will use the report, as well as the complaint form and any of the parties' submissions
to the report
, to decide whether to deal with the complaint [emphasis added] (Letter from CHRC to the Applicant, dated November 22, 2013; AR, Vol 1, Tab 3(A), p 17).
[37]
The subsequent follow-up letter from the CHRC to the Applicant on August 25, 2014, provides her with the Section 40/41 Report and indicates that:
The Commission will make a decision based on the enclosed report, the complaint form, and any submissions (comments) it has received from the parties. For this reason, if you disagree with information in the report, it is important that you take this opportunity to make a submission (Letter from CHRC to the Applicant, dated August 25, 2014; AR, Vol 1, Tab 3(C), p 120).
[38]
The October 3, 2014 letter from CHRC to the Applicant, providing the Respondent's submissions and presenting the Applicant with an opportunity to comment in response states "[t]he Commission will read [the comments] when it is reviewing the report" (Letter from CHRC to the Applicant, dated October 3, 2014; AR, Vol 1, Tab 3(D), p 122).
[39]
These letters illustrate that the Commission considered the Applicant's submissions. Although the August 25, 2014 letter does not specify that the submissions reviewed would be those responding to the Report, the very first letter sent to the Applicant clearly stipulates that submissions to the Report would be considered, along with the Report to decide whether to deal with a complaint. The CHRC ultimately considered the documents it stated it would in that first letter, and therefore I do not find that the Commission made a clear promise to the Applicant that they would consider her Position Letter.
[40]
Moreover, procedural fairness in the CHRA context does not require the Commission to re-consider everything submitted by the parties prior to making its decision ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 63).
[41]
The fifth
Baker
factor, the choices made by the Commission supports a lesser degree of procedural protection. The
CHRA
provides no legislative guidance concerning the procedures to be followed in subsection 41(1) investigations. Further, the Governor in Council has not passed any regulations pursuant to subsection 43(4) regarding the procedure to be followed at the screening stage. As a practical necessity, the Commission must screen complaints before referring them for further inquiry. Their procedural choices at this stage should therefore be afforded deference, so long as they comply with the duty of fairness.
[42]
In summary, when the
Baker
factors are considered as a whole, the procedural fairness to be afforded in the circumstances of applying paragraph 41(1)(d) is on the lower end of the spectrum.
[43]
The investigator's Report must be neutral and thorough, which requires that the parties' arguments be accurately summarized (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The Applicant claims it was neither, as it incorrectly summarized her evidence. A comparison of the Applicant's Position Letter and the Report illustrates that the investigator accurately summarized the Applicant's Position Letter in the Report.
[44]
I disagree with the Applicant's assertion that the present circumstances are analogous to the "game change" in
Air Canada
: this is not a situation involving reversal of the burden of proof whereby the Applicant was prevented from submitting key evidence. The Applicant was informed in various letters what would be considered by the Commission. The Applicant was further given not one, but two, opportunities to respond. The Commission's reliance on the Report in making a final determination is appropriate, considering that reviewing all the same documents considered at the Section 40/41 Report stage would defeat the purposes of the preliminary examination ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 63).
[45]
The Commission carried out its statutory mandate and has complied with its duty of fairness. The Report was neutral and sufficiently thorough. The Applicant had ample opportunity to make submissions and convey her disagreement with the information in the Report. She was provided an opportunity to present her case, and the 10 page limit was not procedurally unfair (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The Report, upon which the Commission's Decision is based, identified the issues, comprehensively canvassed the parties' positions, the factors to be applied in determining if a claim is vexatious, and subsequent information gathered from the parties.
B. Was the CHRC's Decision Reasonable?
[46]
Under the
CHRA
, the Commission should only decline to deal with a complaint at the screening stage if it is "plain and obvious" that the Applicant's complaint falls within one of the subsection 41(1) grounds (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ff'd [1999] FCJ No 705 (FCA) [
Canada Post
]. Thus, it must be plain and obvious that the Applicant had already received a final decision regarding her human rights complaint.
[47]
The Court's role in this judicial review is to determine whether the Commission's determination that the complaint plainly and obviously fell within paragraph 41(1)(d) is reasonable.
[48]
I find that the Decision was reasonable.
(1) Applicant's Position
[49]
The Applicant alleges that the CHRC's decision not to deal with her complaint was unreasonable because (a) she did not receive a final decision, as she was not bound by
Martin
, and (b) her human rights issues have not already been dealt with through another process.
(a) The Applicant Did Not Receive a Final Decision
[50]
The Applicant argues that the CHRC erred in finding that she received a final decision regarding discrimination and in relying on this in its application of paragraph 41(1)(d) of the
CHRA
. Mr. Martin's case is separate and distinct and should have no bearing; she was not a party to his case, nor did she have the opportunity to present evidence or arguments.
[51]
The CHRC found that the Applicant had her day in court because essentially the same allegations of discrimination had been decided in
Martin
and because the Applicant stayed her appeal at the SST-AD and had it dismissed based on the outcome in
Martin
. She claims this position is contrary to the actions of the Umpire, who in grating her stay indicated that once
Martin
was determined, the Applicant could take the appropriate legal steps to resolve her case.
(b) The Applicant's Human Rights Issues Have Never Been Addressed
[52]
The Applicant also argues that this is not a situation where her claim has already been adjudicated on and dismissed by a tribunal with jurisdiction to hear the claim. Rather, the Applicant's complaint filed with the CHRC on October 10, 2013, was the first time she alleged the impugned
EI Act
provisions violate the
CHRA
. The prior EI proceedings only considered interpretation of the
EI Act
with the only issue before the SST-AD being whether the Board was correct in their interpretation - that 35 weeks was awarded per pregnancy or adoption, not per child. Human rights issues were not raised.
(2) Analysis
[53]
Paragraph 41(1)(d) of the
Act
grants the Commission discretion not to deal with a complaint where the issues raised in that complaint have been otherwise dealt with through another process. In the Section 40/41 Report, the Commission was required to determine that the Applicant's situation plainly and obviously fell within paragraph 41(1)(d), and if it did, whether justice required that the complaint be heard regardless (
Canada Post
, above, at para 3).
[54]
It is appropriate to consider the Section 40/41 Report as part of the Commission's reasons: their reasons are brief and they adopt the Report's analysis ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 37). Since the Commission's final decision was based on not just the Report, the parties' further submissions are also relevant.
[55]
The Report reveals that the investigator thoroughly canvassed the facts, the legal principles stemming from relevant case law and the positions of the parties. The Report accurately summarizes the Applicant's position letter. It then analyzes the relevant factors for determining whether a complaint is vexatious, including; whether a decision was made in another process, whether the issues raised during that process were essentially the same as the present issues, whether the complainant raised human rights issues, and whether the complainant finished available reviews or appeals of the decision.
[56]
Although the Report accurately summarized the Applicant's position, the analysis contains some errors, specifically regarding the content of the previous proceedings. Paragraph 75 of the Report inaccurately states that "the allegations of discrimination raised in the complainant's human rights complaint are essentially the same as the issues raised by the complainant under the EI Act Process and decided upon by the SST-AD". This is incorrect. The
EI Act
Process and SST-AD dismissal only dealt with the issue of interpretation of the impugned provisions. It is therefore inaccurate to claim that the Applicant had her day in court regarding the human rights issue at any of the prior proceedings.
[57]
However, the Applicant was given the opportunity to address these errors in her response submissions to the Report, which were considered by the Commission.
[58]
I agree that the Applicant did not receive a final determination regarding discrimination at the SST-AD, however, I disagree that her human rights issues have not been addressed.
[59]
The Applicant's complaint arose from virtually the same set of facts as
Martin
: both involved parents of twins who requested and were denied parental benefits on the basis that their spouses had received the maximum parental benefits payable.
[60]
The FCA in
Martin
interpreted the same provisions of the
EI Act
and determined that these provisions were not discriminatory under section 15 of the
Charter
. The Report canvasses the difference between the legal equality tests under section 15 of the
Charter
and under the
CHRA
and compares the findings in
Martin
with what would be considered under the
CHRA
process, despite the different tests. It ultimately concludes that the Applicant's allegations of discrimination were analyzed through the lens of the section 15
Charter
analysis by the FCA in
Martin
.
[61]
As noted by the Respondent, paragraph 41(1)(d) allows for some divergence with respect to the exact issues raised, remedies available and procedures used. The purpose of the provision would be undermined if an exact parity were required (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[62]
Further, as the Respondent points out,
Brown,
has set a precedent that it is not unreasonable to dismiss a human rights complaint if the human rights issues raised in the complaint have been dealt with under section 15 of the
Charter
(
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
Brown
];
To-Thanh-Hien
, above, at para 41).
[63]
After determining the claim was vexatious within the meaning of the
Act
, the investigator noted that the Commission retained discretion to deal with a complaint if justice required. The Report shows the investigator was alive to the relevant jurisprudence, namely the decisions in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA); <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above; and
Penner
, above.
[64]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> the Supreme Court set out that the principles of finality, fairness and the preservation of the integrity of the justice system by preventing unnecessary inconsistency, multiplicity and delay, are to guide a decision whether to hear an already-decided claim. The Commission is given the task to determine "whether it makes sense to expend public and private resources on the relitigation of what is essentially the same dispute" (paras 36, 37). It is clear the Commission turned its mind to these principles.
[65]
The Commission's decision that the Applicant's claim plainly and obviously fell within paragraph 41(1)(d) is two pronged. Firstly, they determined that the Applicant had exhausted other redress procedures available to her and that a final decision was reached under the SST-AD. For the reasons stated above, I disagree, as it is clear the human rights issues were not raised by the Applicant prior to her complaint at the CHRC. However, the Commission's reasons were also based on the fact that the FCA in
Martin
decided on essentially the same allegations of discrimination under the
Charter
. The fact that
Martin
involved a different individual than the Applicant does not change the inevitable result that the Applicant's underlying facts and arguments have been decided in a manner that negates any prospect for success in her case.
[66]
The Commission is afforded a margin of deference within the range of acceptable and defensible outcomes on the facts and the law, which is broad in these circumstances. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> requires that the Commission's Decision fall within this range and that the Decision is justified, transparent and intelligible. Despite the errors in the Report regarding finality and other redress procedures, the decision in
Martin
in and of itself provides reasonable justification for the Commission's Decision not to deal with the Applicant's complaint.
JUDGMENT
[67]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
1. The application is dismissed;
2. Costs to the Respondent: the parties agreed that those costs should be fixed in the amount of $2750.00.
