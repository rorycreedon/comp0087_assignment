Rouleau, J.
: This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Minister of National Defence to withhold certain information in the personal file of a member of the Canadian Armed Forces which he determines to be "personal" information and exempt from disclosure.
[2]
Initially, the applicant submitted a letter, dated July 7, 1993, to the National Defence Headquarters, Director General Public Affairs, seeking information based on a newspaper report, concerning an offence committed by a Canadian soldier while on service in Somalia.
[3]
The applicant sought 1) a transcript of the charge; 2) a copy of the subsequent disposition; and 3) a copy of the punishment.
[4]
The incident that the applicant referred to in his letter of July 7, 1993 actually took place in Croatia and not in Somalia. The applicant was advised to submit a request to the Access to Information and Privacy Coordinator in order to obtain the requested records relating to the incident. The Access to Information Request Form was received by the National Defence Headquarters, Access to Information Section on September 2, 1993.
[5]
By letter dated September 27, 1993, the applicant was denied a copy of the requested records because, according to the respondent, they were exempt pursuant to s. 19(1) of the
Access to Information Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. A-1. On November 22, 1993, National Defence received a notice of complaint from the office of the Information Commissioner of Canada advising the Department that the applicant had filed a complaint for denial of access. An intra-departmental investigation revealed that a copy of the Charge Report had inadvertently been shown to the media by a member of the Canadian Forces in Croatia. In light of this information, it was decided to release the information relating to the charge and punishment. Subsequently, by letter dated February 16, 1994, information was released to the applicant and a total of six pages were attached. In the same letter, the applicant was advised that exemptions had been applied to some of the information pursuant to s. 19(1) of the
Access to Information Act
and was identified in the released pages with a number one encircled.
[6]
The only question in issue is whether the decision to refuse disclosure to the applicant of the information exempt is justified pursuant to the
Access to Information Act
and the
Privacy Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-21.
[7]
According to the
Report of the Standing Committee on Justice and Solicitor General on the Review of the Access to Information Act and the Privacy Act
,
"Under the
Access to Information Act
, any Canadian citizen or permanent resident may, on application and payment of the appropriate fees, have access to records under the control of government institutions. The only government institutions currently subject to the
Act
are those set out in a Schedule to the
Act
. Government institutions may refuse access to records under their control if the records sought fail within the classes or records described in a number of broad exemptions in the
Act
. Any records classified as cabinet confidences are not accessible under the
Act
.
"If an applicant believes that access to a record is being unfairly denied, a complaint may be filed with the Information Commissioner. The Information Commissioner, and independent officer directly accountable to Parliament, conducts an investigation and makes nonbinding recommendation to the government institution and the complainant. If the government institution continues to withhold the requested records, the applicant may apply to the Federal Court for a binding order.
. . . . .
"In addition to the exemptions from access, as in the
Access to Information Act
, the
Privacy Act
currently provides that whole banks of personal information are exempt from access where all the files which they contain consist predominantly of information relating to international affairs, defence matters or police investigations."
[8]
The purpose of both
Acts
is, according to the
Report of the Standing Committee on Justice and Solicitor General on the Review of the Access to Information Act and the Privacy Act
:
"in the case of the
Access to Information Act
, to provide greater rights of access to records controlled by government institutions;"
and
"in the case of the
Privacy Act
, to assure the protection of Canadian's privacy with respect to personal information about them which is held by government institutions."
[9]
The principle underlying the
Access to Information Act
is found in s. 2(1) of the
Act
. Disclosure is the general rule and the refusal of disclosure is the exception. As it is stated in
Government Information: Access and Privacy
(1989) (Colin H.H. McNairn and Christopher D. Woodbury):
"In general terms, access legislation provides for access to all information in records controlled by government institutions unless there is a specific provision in the legislation that either permits or requires the government to refuse to disclose the information."
and stated by Mr. Justice Mackay in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.):
"To paraphrase Jerome, A.C.J., in
Davidson
(35 C.C.C.(3d) 91-92), access to information is to be the norm, exemptions are to be confined to situations explicitly set out in each act; under both status the onus of establishing the basis for not disclosing information requested rests with the party who seeks to avoid disclosure."
[10]
The burden of proof rests upon the party who objects to disclosure pursuant to s. 48 of the
Access to Information Act
.
"48. In any proceedings before the court arising from an application under section 41 or 42, the burden of establishing that the head of a government institution is authorized to refuse to disclose a record requested under this Act or a part thereof shall be on the government institution concerned."
[11]
It is therefore the respondent who has to establish that the information requested by the applicant falls under s. 19(1) of the
Access to Information Act
.
[12]
In the case at bar, the applicant requested a transcript of the charge, a copy of the subsequent disposition and the punishment imposed. The information was released because a copy of the Charge Report had inadvertently been shown to the media by a member of the Canadian Forces in Croatia. However, not all that was requested by the applicant was released. The information that was withheld is the following:
a) from pages 001, 002 and 005, the Service Number of the individual;
b) from page 003, information describing the mental disposition of the individual which led to the incident; information concerning the date of birth and date of enrolment, as well as good conduct medals and badges;
c) from page 004, character assessment;
d) from page 006, Service number, reasons for which an individual might have been released prior to the termination of the 30 day sentence, and information describing the conduct, medical and mental state of the individual.
[13]
I must now determine whether the information (or part of the information) that is requested by the applicant is "personal information" pursuant to s. 19(1) of the
Access to Information Act
and s. 3 of the
Privacy Act
. According to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.):
"Because the purpose of the
Privacy Act
is to protect the privacy of 'personal information', the general rule is that information about identifiable individuals is 'personal information' and only if a specific exemption applies, would such information not be 'personal information'. It follows that a party wishing to demonstrate that information about an identifiable individual is not 'personal information' must show that an exemption applies."
[14]
After review, it is clear to me that the information being sought is "personal information" under s. 3 of the
Privacy Act
. However, the applicant submits that since the individual, whose personal information is presumed to be protected, was a Non-Commissioned Officer in the Canadian Armed Forces, then s. 3(j) of the
Privacy Act
should apply. I have concluded that the exceptions found in s. 3(j) of the
Privacy Act
are very specific and should be interpreted narrowly. The rule of interpretation "expressio unius est exclusio alterius" has to be followed when interpreting this paragraph.
"but, for the purposes of sections 7, 8 and 26 and section 19 of the
Access to Information Act
, does not include
j) information about an individual who is or was an officer or employee of a government institution that relates to the position or functions of the individual including,
i) the fact that the individual is or was an officer or employee of the government institution
ii) the title, business, address and telephone number of the individual,
iii) the classification, salary range and responsibilities or the position held by the individual,
iv) the name of the individual in a document prepared by the individual in the course of the employment, and
v) the personal opinions or views of the individual given in the course of employment."
[15]
In the present case, I have not been persuaded that the information requested by the applicant falls under any of these headings.
[16]
The applicant also argued that since some documents were shown to the media, s. 19(2)(b) is applicable rather than s. 19(1) under which the disclosure was refused. I do not agree since disclosure of the document to the media occurred "inadvertently" and only for one document, namely the Charge Report. In fact, National Defence released more information to the applicant than to the media and withheld only information that it considered "personal information". According to s. 19(2) of the
Act
, National Defence had the discretion to withhold information that contains personal information and that is exactly what it did.
"19(1) Subject to subsection (2), the head of a government institution shall refuse to disclose any record requested under this Act that contains personal information as defined in section 3 of the Privacy Act.
"(2) The head of a government institution
may
disclose any record requested under this Act and that contains personal information if
(a) the individual to whom it relates consents to the disclosure
(b) the information is publicly available; or
(c) the disclosure is in accordance with section 8 of the Privacy Act" (my emphasis)
[17]
The applicant further submitted that it is in the public interest that the information he is requesting be disclosed. Being a former member of the military and still having an interest in military matters, he stated that he would only disclose the information to other members of his circle so they could discuss it. I do not see how the requested information could be of any public interest and should be released pursuant to s. 8 of the
Privacy Act
.
"8(1) Personal information under the control of a government institution shall not, without the consent of the individual to whom it relates, be disclosed by the institution except in accordance with this section.
"(2) Subject to any other Act of Parliament, personal information under the control of a government institution may be disclosed
. . . . .
(m) for any purpose where, in the opinion of the head of the institution,
(i) the public interest in disclosure clearly outweighs any invasion of privacy that could result from the disclosure, or
(ii) disclosure would clearly benefit the individual to whom the information relates."
[18]
Accordingly, for the above reasons, this application for judicial review is dismissed.
Application dismissed.
