Strayer, J.
: The plaintiff in this action and in another action between the same parties, T-2130-85, brought an application purportedly under Rule 465 for an order, inter alia, declaring that:
"... the Defendant ... is ... not entitled to have present at the discovery of the Plaintiff's representative the person whom the Defendant has chosen to produce as its representative to be examined for discovery."
An accompanying affidavit disclosed that on the day agreed upon by counsel for the examination of a representative of the plaintiff, counsel for the defendant had with her one Bernard Fournier, a representative of the defendant who was the person designated to be examined for discovery the next day by counsel for the plaintiff. Counsel for the plaintiff objected to Fournier being present during the examination of the representative of the plaintiff. The examination did not proceed and counsel brought these motions, one in each action. I dismissed both motions, gave brief oral reasons, and indicated that I would give written reasons having regard to the novelty of the question.
[2]
At the outset I had some doubts as to my jurisdiction to give such directions. I was finally satisfied that, while there is no precise authority in Rule 465 to this effect, the matter could be treated as one in which the plaintiff's representative had refused to be examined with Fournier present, it then being a matter under Rule 465(20) for the court to determine whether there was "reasonable excuse" for this refusal. I also noted the decision of Mahoney, J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , where he made a determination as to whether an expert witness was entitled to be present to assist counsel in the examination of a party in opposition.
[3]
In reaching the conclusion which I did, I started with the proposition that an individual normally is entitled to attend court proceedings to which he is a party. Where the party is not a natural person but a corporation or the Crown, then such party is entitled to have a representative present. Fournier is a representative of the defendant in this action.
[4]
My reading of the cases suggest that while there area exceptions to this principle such exceptions are few and would involve unusual circumstances. Even in a trial, where a party or the instructing representative of a party is an intended witness, where an order is made for the exclusion of other witnesses prior to their testimony the court would not normally exclude such a person. This is so even though the practice is to make exclusionary orders whenever so requested. This obviously reflects the importance attached to the right of a party to be present and to instruct counsel throughout the case.
[5]
In some respects I believe that it is even more important that a party's representative be present during an examination for discovery of the opposing party. It is in the interests of justice that examinations for discovery should be complete and this implies that the questioning should be as relevant as possible. The object is to explore fully the issues raised by the pleadings, to understand the position of the party being examined and to gain admissions from him. This is all in furtherance of the goal of narrowing the issues and reducing as much as possible matters to be determined at trial. All of this underlines the importance of examining counsel being well instructed by his client during the course of the examination.
[6]
The argument of the plaintiff here is essentially that the presence of the defendant's representative during the examination of the plaintiff's representative is "unfair" because it could enable the former to "tailor" his "evidence" in the light of the "evidence" of the latter. No basis for this apprehension is stated in the supporting affidavit. It is simply put forward as a general proposition. I find this inadequate for two reasons. First, I think it overemphasizes the role of an examinee as a "witness". An examinee is not necessarily giving "evidence" of his personal knowledge and observations as does a witness at trial, but rather is there to state the position of the party he represents. In doing so he may be giving purely hearsay evidence. The purpose of the examination is not to obtain disclosure of the intended evidence of the particular examinee but rather of facts relevant to the pleadings which are within the knowledge of the other party. These considerations in my view reduce considerably the relevancy of concerns about witnesses to a particular incident being able to "tailor" their evidence in the light of knowledge of each others evidence. Secondly, for reasons stated earlier as to the importance of a party's representative being present with his counsel, it is unacceptable in my view to take the view that such a person can never be present when the opposite party is being examined if he is himself to be examined in future. It would have to be very special circumstances to justify the exclusion of such a person and the plaintiff's material discloses no such circumstances here.
[7]
For these reasons the motions were dismissed with costs in the cause. These reasons apply equally, of course, to the motion brought in action T-2130-85.
Application dismissed.
