Rouleau, J.
: This was an application to stay a reference as to damages resulting from a decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in which it was determined that the defendants had infringed certain claims of the plaintiff's patent. Subsequent to the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal, the defendants, in June of 1995, filed an application for leave to the Supreme Court of Canada. It was argued that the reference should be stayed until such time as the Supreme Court of Canada decides whether or not they are prepared to entertain the appeal from the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal.
[2]
The main argument submitted by the plaintiff in attacking this request can be summarized in the proposition that the Trial Division of this court had no jurisdiction to entertain the motion.
[3]
My review of the authorities would seem to support the proposition that this matter should have been brought before the Federal Court of Appeal. Though a reference had initially been indicated by the Trial Division prior to the hearing of the action, this direction would not become effective until such time as a decision was rendered by a court either in favour of the plaintiff or the defendant. The Federal Court of Appeal reversed the Trial Division and it is the ultimate decision of the latter court from which one is seeking to stay the execution.
[4]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 158 (F.C.A.), the unsuccessful party at the Trial Division was seeking a stay of the decision of the Trial Division before the Court of Appeal before the matter had been entertained by them. Mr.Â Justice Thurlow, writing for the court, indicated at p. 159:
"In the context, the court referred to, as it seems to me, is the court in respect of whose judgment the stay is sought, that is to say, in this case, the Trial Division. An interpretation of the rule which would permit the bringing of this application in the first instance in the Court of Appeal, would, as it seems to me, be fraught with consequences that could be unreasonable and unfair. Logically, it would lead to the view that a judgment of the Court of Appeal on an appeal from the Trial Division could be stayed by the Trial Division. On the other hand, if such an application were heard in the Court of Appeal by a single Judge, the unsuccessful party would have no redress by appeal to a multiple court other than to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. As a matter of interpretation, therefore, I am of the opinion that the Rule does not contemplate an application such as this."
[5]
By analogy: here we have a decision from the Federal Court of Appeal, that indicates to me that the matter does not belong in the Trial Division.
[6]
It was further submitted that to proceed in the preparation of a reference prior to a determination by the Supreme Court of Canada as to whether or not an appeal will be entertained could be of considerable inconvenience and expense amounting to irreparable harm. I do not accept this submission and I prefer to rely on the reasoning of Mahoney, J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), where he wrote:
"I accept that, here, the expense and inconvenience of the reference will be substantial and that that, by itself, is not sufficient ground for the exercise of the Court's discretion to stay it. 'Irreparable damage', in its ordinary sense, is damage that cannot be compensated by an award of money."
[7]
Finally, I was referred to s. 65.1 of the
Supreme Court Act
which speaks of stays of execution and applications for leave to appeal.
[8]
Paragraphs 65.1(1), (2) and (3) provide as follows:
"65.1(1) The court, the court appealed from or a judge of either of those courts may, on the request of the party who has served and filed a notice of application for leave to appeal, order that proceedings be stayed with respect to the judgment from which leave to appeal is being sought, on the terms deemed appropriate.
"(2) The court appealed from or a judge of that court may exercise the power conferred by subsection (1) before the serving and filing of the notice of application for leave to appeal if satisfied that the party seeking the stay intends to apply for leave to appeal and that delay would result in a miscarriage of justice.
"(3) The court, the court appealed from or a judge of either of those courts may modify, vary or vacate a stay order made under this section."
[9]
This rule clearly supports the respondent/plaintiff's position and as I see it, s. 65 of the
Supreme Court Act
is not the proper section to rely upon in these circumstances.
[10]
For the above reasons, the application is dismissed. Costs to the plaintiff.
Application dismissed.
